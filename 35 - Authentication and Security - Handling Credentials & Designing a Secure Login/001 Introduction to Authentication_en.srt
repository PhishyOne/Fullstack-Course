00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,290
All right guys, welcome to a brand new module.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,780
And in this module we're going to tackle the topic of Authentication.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,550
And it's something that is often thought of as incredibly complicated,

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,230
but it doesn't have to be.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,650
And we're going to take it step by step from beginning to end so that you get an overview of the entire

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,710
process of setting up authentication from scratch.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,680
So why do we need to authenticate?

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,570
Well, as we're creating our website or web app for users to use, then these users are going to start

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,390
generating data in the website.

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,020
They might like certain posts, they might interact with other users, there might be messages created

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,700
or recipes created,

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,940
there's always going to be some user data created.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,960
And in order to associate those pieces of data with individual users, we need to create an Account

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,100
for each user.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,600
So they would sign up to our website using a username and a password.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,440
And we would essentially create kind of like an ID card for them to uniquely identify them on our database

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,600
and to save all of the data that they generate onto that account.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,660
So the next time that they come back onto the website, they'll be able to use their username and password

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:28,100
and log in to our website and be able to access all of those possibly private pieces of information.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,350
So this way you don't end up with everybody being able to see, you know, what private messages you're

21
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,220
sending around on Facebook or see your direct messages on Twitter.

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,960
So that's pretty simple.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,260
Now, the other reason why you might want to add authentication to your website is to restrict access

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,700
to certain areas of the website, depending on the status of the user.

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:57,350
So for example, if you were Spotify or Netflix and you charge a subscription for accessing certain

26
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,050
parts of the website, then once the user pays, you have to update their account in your database to

27
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,770
say that they have paid and they'll be allowed to access the TV shows or songs that they're entitled

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,190
to.

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,960
Those are some of the reasons why you might want to add authentication to your website, but authentication

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,570
can be done in a number of ways.

31
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:27,170
Creating a website where we sign up and log in users seems simple enough, but the difficult part of

32
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,420
authentication comes from how secure you're going to make your website.

33
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:40,970
And we're going to tackle this problem of authentication by going through the different levels of security.

34
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:47,300
So we're going to go from very basic creating an account, adding the user to our database, saving

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,630
their username and password to enable them to log in all the way up to covering things such as OAuth

36
00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:00,260
and social logins, including creating things such as sessions and cookies and hashing and encrypting

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,960
passwords and it's going to be more than you'd ever want to know about this topic, but it's really,

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,940
really important that you learn it in the beginning, because later on, once you've understood and

39
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,210
you've built authentication from the bottom up, then I'm going to show you some ways of simplifying

40
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,500
and making your life easier using third-party libraries like Passport.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:27,200
So we're going to learn how to progress from essentially a website that's basically secured with a Cheeto

42
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,430
to something that is a lot more serious and more consistent with industry standards of good security

43
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,330
on a website.

44
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:43,580
If you're not interested in learning how to authenticate users from the very basics all the way up to

45
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:50,240
the most complicated, if you just want to skip ahead right to the end where we cover OAuth using third-

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,070
party social logins such as Google or Facebook, then feel free to do that.

47
00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:01,400
But I strongly, strongly recommend that you follow along the entire tutorial, not only because there's

48
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,280
some pretty good jokes coming up, if I might say so myself, but also because it will help you build

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,910
a foundation of knowledge around this topic so that when you see it in the wild, you won't be stumped.

50
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,300
Once you're ready, we're going to get started building a website that keeps secrets.

51
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,290
Makes sense, right?

52
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,190
Authentication.

53
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,540
There is an app called Whisper that you might have come across,

54
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:33,770
and it's a really simple concept, that basically allows people to submit their secrets anonymously.

55
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:42,200
So whatever they post are not associated with a email or a username, and it means that people can express

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,330
themselves, I guess, more freely.

57
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,480
It's quite a fun website, and this is what we're going to try and replicate by the end of this module.

58
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,290
So the structure of our website is really, really simple.

59
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:59,600
It has a home page which has two buttons that allows you to.

60
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,790
Either go towards register or go towards login.

61
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,610
And once the user has been registered or logged in and they have been authenticated, then they are

62
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,340
able to access the secrets page.

63
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:18,550
So I've kept the remainder of the website pretty simple because we're going to be focusing on a pretty

64
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,660
complex topic.

65
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,470
So I've created some starting files for you to download so that we can focus our efforts on learning

66
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,910
authentication and not get distracted by things like Bootstrap and styling.

67
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,460
Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson, and then we're going to get started with our Level 1

68
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,980
Security Authentication.

69
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,480
So I'll see you there.
