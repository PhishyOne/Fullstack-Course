00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,550
Way, way back at the beginning of the course, we introduced you to GitHub.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:12,020
In this module I want to introduce you formally to how Git works and how you can use it to achieve various

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,860
powerful ends.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,460
And I'm going to be talking about and showing you how you can use Git on the command line to do things

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,020
such as Version Control or how to Clone repositories, how to Fork, make Pull Requests and Merge repositories

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,630
and a whole bunch of really, really exciting things.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,000
So let's talk about Version Control

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,370
in its simplest form. Let's say that I create a new code file and I write a few lines in it,

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,060
now, I decide to put it under version control using Git.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,510
And let's say that I call this save point Number 1.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,880
Now this is my first version.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,220
So later on, as I progress, I write maybe a few more lines of code.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,000
And at this point I decide to make another save point.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,820
And I call this my second version.

15
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,700
Further down the line, I accidentally screw up my entire code file and it's irreparable,

16
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,810
and I get to the point where I would rather burn my entire code file rather than having to try and fix

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:13,260
it.

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,260
You do get into these situations because very often your code is interlinked and each class depends

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,980
on another.

20
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,600
And sometimes you can screw up in a way where, you know, all hope is lost,

21
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,310
and I simply just want to roll back to the last save point.

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,770
I can do that using Git.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,830
You can either compare your current code file so the current mess that you've made against a previous

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,280
version.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,460
So add any of the save points before.

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,500
Alternatively, you can simply just roll back to a previous version and it doesn't have to be the one

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,330
that was immediately previous,

28
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:54,420
you can go as far back or as far forwards as you like as long as you know which version you want.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,570
In the next lesson, I'm going to show you version control using Git locally on your computer and we're

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,730
going to use the command line to do this.

31
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
I'll see you there.
