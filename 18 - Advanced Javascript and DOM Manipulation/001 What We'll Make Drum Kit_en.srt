00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,160
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,970
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,780
This is Angela from The App Brewery,

4
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,590
and in this module we're going to be making something really awesome.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:13,700
We're moving upwards in the world and we're going to be building much much cooler web sites.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:19,440
So, in order to teach you about some of the more intermediate / advanced parts of the Document Object Model

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,750
or the DOM, I wanted to show you how you can build this drum kit web site.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:31,700
So by the end of this module you would have not only understood how to add event listeners to buttons

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,340
and keystrokes so that you'll know when the user is tapping on the keyboard or clicking on a particular

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,420
button on your web site and you can respond to it,

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,530
but you also end up with this awesome web site that you can impress all of your friends with.

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:51,230
So the way that this works is that we've got a number of keys here that represent different drums in

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,810
a typical drum set.

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:58,830
And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,530
And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,420
So now every time I crack a terrible programming joke, I'll be able to give you a drum roll.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,040
So I hope you're ready.

18
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,770
It's going to be really exciting.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,990
Let's get started in the next lesson.
