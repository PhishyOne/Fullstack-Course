1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,370
Now in the previous lesson, we saw how we were able to render this sell button and allow the user who

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,310
owns this NFT to put in a price and to list their NFT for sale.

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,610
Now, at the moment, it works, but if you're looking at it from the frontend as a user, you would

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,600
never know that it works because none of the user interface updates.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,560
And we also want to be able to click on the Discover page to see all of the NFTs listed for sale.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,890
So that's what we're going to be tackling in this lesson.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,600
Now, the first thing we're going to do is to set up our loaders. Similar to previously inside our minter

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,790
where we got our loader to show up when the minting is happening,

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,580
we're also going to get our loader to show up when we are listing and transferring our NFT.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,650
If you want, you can copy either the loader code from the minter or even better yet, copy it from the

11
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,250
read me.

12
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,750
And going into the item.jsx, we're going to paste it just below our image here.

13
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,990
Now we're going to add the hidden attribute in here and we're going to use the loaderHidden.

14
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,650
And we're going to add that up here, of course.

15
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,190
And we're going to set the initial state to true so that our loader is hidden in the beginning.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,510
Now the time when we want our loader to start loading is once the user has clicked on the confirm button,

17
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,080
which triggers the sellItem function right here.

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,000
So we're going to set the loader hidden to false now, and then once all of our listing is completed and

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,890
our transfer is completed,

20
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,150
so if we go ahead and add another statement, the transferResult is equal to success,

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,720
then in this case, we're going to go ahead and set our loader to be hidden again.

22
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,910
So set it to true.

23
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:21,540
So now let's go ahead and hit save and take a look inside our NFTs.

24
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,630
If you see nothing here, then you might have to mint some because they disappear when we deploy.

25
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,390
But let's try selling one of these NFTs.

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,920
You can see that as soon as I click confirm, my loader starts up and going through listing and transfer,

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,830
it still continues until the transfer is successful, at which point the loader disappears, which is

28
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,210
exactly what we would want.

29
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:52,890
Now, the other thing that we want to disappear once the transfer is completed are the button and also

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,940
this price input.

31
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,720
So we can use our setButton and setPriceInput to make them disappear here as well,

32
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,620
like so.

33
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,380
And if we try that again, making sure that we actually pick the one that we can sell, and if you don't

34
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,490
have any others that you can sell, then you have to mint some.

35
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,040
And the reason why they can't sell is because this one's been transferred over to OpenD, so we actually

36
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,560
don't have the right to sell it again.

37
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,780
We're going to address this a little bit later on, but let's try it with this one or another one that

38
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,350
you mint.

39
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,050
So once that's done, all of those pieces of the UI disappear, which is brilliant,

40
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,960
but we now need to update the owner because the owner is now the OpenD canister.

41
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,450
And rather than just pulling in this principal which doesn't mean anything to the user, I'm going

42
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,090
to change that to just say OpenD.

43
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:01,770
So over here, I'm going to set the owner to a piece of text that's just going to be OpenD.

44
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,170
And that way, the user who's looking at this will know that it has been listed and the ownership temporarily

45
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,770
transferred to OpenD.

46
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,480
Now the final thing I'd like to do is to be able to blur the image once we've listed it, because it's

47
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,399
sort of transferred over in terms of ownership to OpenD, it's listed. It's not something that you should

48
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,000
be able to sell again or to be able to interact with that much.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:34,270
So we're going to add a style to our image here and the style is going to be set equal to something

50
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,410
that we're going to call blur.

51
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,240
And blur, of course, needs to be set up here.

52
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,880
So it's going to be blur and setBlur.

53
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,030
And it's going to start out with nothing.

54
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,850
Now, the point where we actually setBlur is at the beginning of our sell item,

55
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,980
so we're going to call setBlur.

56
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:07,320
And what we're going to do is we're basically going to add some CSS to the styling of that image

57
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:07,860
element.

58
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,170
Basically, we add it on the fly and the CSS attribute is called a filter

59
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,980
and we're going to set it to a string that's called blur.

60
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,510
And then we get to determine how much blur inside a set of parentheses.

61
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,550
And I'm going to set it to a minimal amount,

62
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:30,390
so 4px. You'll still be able to see the actual image behind it, but it will be sufficiently

63
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,130
blurry that you'll notice a difference.

64
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,320
Let's go ahead and hit save and mint a new NFT to try it out.

65
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,410
Let's go ahead and sell this new NFT.

66
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,210
Click confirm.

67
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,100
Our blur shows up,

68
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,630
our loader shows up

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,430
Our blur doesn't go away

70
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,910
because that way we know that we don't actually quite own it anymore

71
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,440
and it's listed for sale.

72
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,230
And we've got quite a lot of feedback to tell us that, in fact, this has been successfully listed

73
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,800
for sale.

74
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,930
Now, the only thing is, when we actually refresh our site, you'll notice that the owner OpenD and

75
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,860
the button and the blur will not obey what we told it to do.

76
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,450
And this is because when we load up an item, when we refresh it, it goes into load NFT.

77
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:26,100
So we need a way to check to see if this particular item with this particular ID is actually listed

78
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,730
for sale.

79
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,630
To do that, we can go into our main.

80
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,290
mo

81
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,990
and create a new function.

82
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:45,490
The new function is simply going to be a public query func and it's going to be called is

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:53,860
Listed, and we get to pass in the id of a NFT and we're going to return a boolean,

84
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,910
so true or false, and that will reflect whether or not it's listed.

85
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:08,080
Let's add a semicolon at the top and we're going to use an if statement to check that out of our map

86
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,250
of listings.

87
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:21,850
If we run a get using this id that's passed in, if it equals null, well then that means that NFT

88
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,780
is not listed,

89
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,000
right? Because it's not in our map of listings.

90
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,490
So we're going to return false.

91
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:37,000
But otherwise, then it means it exists and it's not equal to null, in which case we will return

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,540
true.

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,610
Let's go ahead and call this function from our frontend here.

94
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:53,310
And just before we set our buttons, I'm going to create a new constant called nftIsListed

95
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:02,360
and it's going to be using the await OpenD.IsListed function that we just created and we're

96
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,710
going to pass in the props.id.

97
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,790
So now we can use that constant,

98
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:19,820
if the nftIsListed, then we're going to set the owner to again OpenD.

99
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,970
And we're going to set the blur as well.

100
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,020
So I'm just going to copy and paste that line of code that I had down here.

101
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:41,380
And if it's not listed, so in the else statement, then it will actually set the button to say, sell.

102
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,540
Now, by default, the button is nothing.

103
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,460
So that means unless it's listed, it won't have that sell button.

104
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,260
And if it is listed, then the owner is OpenD and the image is blurred out.

105
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,160
And now all we have to do is go ahead and redeploy all of our canisters

106
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:09,460
making sure in our did files for the OpenD that that new isListed method actually is added.

107
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,510
And once it is, we can hit save, we'll lose our NFT when we refresh.

108
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,570
But when we go ahead and click sell

109
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,390
this time, we'll get the blurring,

110
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,740
we'll get the loading

111
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,050
and we'll get all of those things disappearing once it's all done.

112
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,910
And even when we refresh the page, all of those properties will stay as they are because it knows that

113
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,230
it's already been listed.

114
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:47,120
Now, one final frontend thing that I would like to add is at the very bottom of item.jsx, you'll

115
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,300
see a section that says purple-text.

116
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,430
And this is a span that I put in there. And it'd be really nice if we could just get it to say listed

117
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,480
or rather space and then listed just so that will know at a glance that it's been listed and we'll know

118
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,770
that's why it's blurry.

119
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,460
So let's go ahead and add this as a constant.

120
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,140
And remember, if you want that space, just add a space before the curly braces. And I'm going to set

121
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,420
this to sellStatus

122
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,160
and add it as a constant.

123
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,280
And initialize it as an empty string.

124
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:40,570
But when the NFT is listed, we're going to set the sellStatus to say listed.

125
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,660
And similarly, once our selling is completed, we're going to set the same thing,

126
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,590
so sellStatus to a Listed.

127
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,070
And there you have it.

128
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,160
That's our styling done for all the listing.

129
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:06,960
Now, the next thing we'd like to do is to grab hold of all the listed NFTs and display it on the Discover

130
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,420
page so that you can see all of the NFTs that are being offered for sale on OpenD.

131
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,170
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
