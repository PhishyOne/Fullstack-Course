1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,830
All right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,470
So there's a really big and exciting project that's coming up.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:13,050
We're going to be building an NFT marketplace where we can mint, list and sell non-fungible tokens on

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,370
the Internet computer. If you don't know what nfts are,

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,790
this is a really simple explanation.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,110
They're called non-fungible tokens because one NFT is unique and can't be exchanged for another.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
For example, if you have a $100 bill and it doesn't matter what markings you've got on it or if it's

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,910
scratched up or if it's a little bit wrinkled, it is exchangeable for another hundred dollar bill.

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,250
It's completely identical in the eyes of anyone who holds it or the bank.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,670
For example, the other day I was traveling in Costa Rica and I had a 10,000 Costa Rican colones bill

11
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,000
which got caught onto my jumper, and when I tried to tug on it, it just ripped in half, which was

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,700
really sad because it's actually worth quite a lot.

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,519
So I was thinking, is this the end of my 10,000 colone

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,920
bill? Well, actually, I could just go into the bank, give them my two pieces,

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,230
and once they verified that it was not some sort of counterfeit that I produced, they gave me a new

16
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,150
10,000 colone bill.

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,030
So they're completely identical to each other.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,390
Now, the concept of an NFT is, well, okay, we've created all these tokens, right?

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,720
We've created the Ethereum token, we've created Bitcoin.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,630
Well, you've created that DANG token or whatever it is you called it, your own custom token, but they're

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,590
all interchangeable.

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,260
What if instead we created tokens on the blockchain that were unique?

23
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,710
So they had unique identifiers, they had unique features.

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,210
And here we have these files, most commonly images, that artists have created which are completely unique.

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,960
So if you went into the lourve and you saw the Mona Lisa, there is only one Mona Lisa.

26
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:08,250
It doesn't matter how good a replica-- You could completely, you know, clone all the atoms and all of

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,440
the molecules in the Mona Lisa and create another one,

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,160
it still won't be the original Mona Lisa and you won't be able to sell it as the famous Mona Lisa,

29
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,460
right?

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,190
So I think you get my point.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,150
And recently the NFT craze has hotted up and it's completely gone out of control.

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,500
The most recent sort of mainstream news is Christies, which is a famous auctioneer selling pieces

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,170
by Picasso or by Leonardo da Vinci, sold a collection by Beeple who is an NFT creator.

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,160
And he had a collection called Everydays, where he created a piece of digital art every day for 5000

35
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,890
days, which is actually pretty impressive achievement.

36
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,750
And this collection was auctioned at Christies and was sold for over 69 million U.S. dollars.

37
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,570
So the NFT craze is definitely real.

38
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,970
Now, you might have thought about creating an NFT yourself, especially if you're a good artist.

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,020
But as developers we can do even one step better.

40
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,630
We can create the marketplace where people can mint, list and sell the NFT.

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,360
One of the most famous marketplaces, one of the largest marketplaces as well, is something called

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,260
OpenSea.

43
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,540
And on Opensea you can list and you can sell NFTs. And you can see that the NFTs on here are not cheap.

44
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,180
So if you're looking at a collection, for example, really famous group called the Bored Ape Yatch Club

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,810
have 10,000 items on Opensea.

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,770
And if you look at the prices for them that people are bidding on, they're sort of averaging

47
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:50,430
around the sort of 100 eth mark right? Now,

48
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,750
if we take a look at how much 100 ETH is actually worth in dollars, at least at the moment it's worth

49
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:03,030
something like 335,000 U.S. dollars.

50
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,080
And that's just a single one of these pieces of digital art.

51
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,470
So that's not even like a collection or anything.

52
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:18,930
And for every single piece of art that's sold on Opensea, the platform will charge a 2.5% transaction

53
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,290
fee.

54
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,500
So as always, if you're not Bored Ape Yacht Club and you're already super famous, it's always better

55
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,770
to be the platform than to be the individual creator.

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,020
The project that we're going to be building is a NFT e-commerce site that's inspired by Opensea as can

57
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,880
be built with React on the frontend,

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,640
Motoko and Internet computer supporting the backend.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,600
And the best part of it is while most current NFTs are sold and bought for large amounts of money,

60
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,610
when you actually look at the actual item, most of the original files are actually stored on a third

61
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,480
party server.

62
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,490
So let's take this NFT, for example, number 5465.

63
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,750
If you take a look at its details on Opensea, it's actually got a contract address which if you click

64
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,520
on it, will take you to Etherscan.

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,390
And here you can actually take a look and read the original contract, which includes a link to the

66
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,960
token

67
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,740
URI.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,920
So we pass in that ID 5465.

69
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,140
It'll show us the identifier for this item on ipfs.

70
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,150
Ipfs stores

71
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,500
a lot of the NFTs that are currently in circulation. And we get hold of the actual URL of this item

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,630
by simply going to it in the browser bar like so.

73
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,880
And here it is.

74
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:55,750
This is the actual hosted URL of this original NFT, which anyone can access, by the way.

75
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,970
You don't have to own it, and you can access it in its original size, original format.

76
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:08,770
But when we're creating our version of Opensea, all the NFT minted on there will be created on the

77
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,060
Internet computer blockchain.

78
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,050
And that means that the NFT data, as in the actual bits and bytes themselves, will be stored on-chain.

79
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,350
And that's quite different from just having a smart contract with a URL that points to Ipfs or worse

80
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,810
still, a single company's private server.

81
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,840
Now, the website and collection that we're going to be creating is inspired by one of the original

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
NFT, which is called the Cryptopunks.

83
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,920
And that is really cute little pieces of pixel art where each cryptopunk has some unique features.

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,840
For example, some have hats,

85
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:51,520
some have these cool 3D glasses, and depending on which feature you like or you want, then the price

86
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,840
really varies accordingly.

87
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,650
And you can see that some of these were sold for really crazy prices like this one here.

88
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:07,180
This guy with blue eyeshadow was sold for a whopping 124,000 ether, which if you want to know how much

89
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,510
that is, it's something crazy.

90
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:19,540
Like I don't even know how many zeros there are here. That's currently worth like $415 million, which

91
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,850
is absolutely insane.

92
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,600
So to save you from having to spend millions of dollars acquiring these pieces of art to be able to

93
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:37,840
build your own NFT marketplace, I have very helpfully created some for you using a website called pixil

94
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,530
art.com.

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,980
I've created some of these pixel characters inspired by the original Cryptopunks.

96
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,750
This is what they look like.

97
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,390
I've got a collection of six, which you'll be able to download in the course resources in the Udemy

98
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,580
course once we get to that stage.

99
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,220
So I drew these from scratch and they're obviously not as great as, you know, a real artist or whatever,

100
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,720
but I think they're kind of cute and I think for our purposes they'll work just fine.

101
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:13,440
The final website that we're going to be making, the OpenD is going to have a lot of features.

102
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,070
This is actually quite a big project.

103
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,450
So we've simplified down a lot of the OpenSea features and we've pared it down to just the core functionality

104
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,130
that we need to wrap your head around.

105
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:33,220
There is a section where we can view the NFTs that the logged in user owns, and the user can sell these

106
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:41,380
NFTs by clicking on sell and then setting a price in DANG, the Angela coin, which anyone can claim from

107
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,870
the previous project that we created. and once these items are sold,

108
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,540
then you'll be able to see them on the Discover page where they're listed for people to buy.

109
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,480
Now, you obviously can't buy an item that you've listed, but you can buy items that other people own

110
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,940
that they've listed. On this Discover page,

111
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,300
you'll be able to pay in DANG coins.

112
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,470
This one costs two DANG and you'll be able to purchase these individual NFTs which you'll then see

113
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,940
in your collection.

114
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,080
Now you'll also be able to mint NFT on here.

115
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,040
And this will create a unique canister on the Internet

116
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:33,960
Computer blockchain that contains all of the data for your image file that you've just minted. And

117
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,320
once they're minted, you'll be able to see them in your collection as well,

118
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,500
ready for sale or just simply for you to keep and to hold.

119
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,550
So I'm super excited about this project.

120
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,500
It took me a really, really long time to figure out all the nuts and bolts of it and to simplify it

121
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,820
to a point where we can build it relatively quickly and learn all the important stuff around NFTs, programmatically

122
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,930
creating canisters, buying and selling NFTs through the transfer of a third party token, such

123
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,680
as the Angela coin that we created early on, and managing all of the e-commerce requirements of this website.

124
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:16,230
So it's a really fun project and I'm so excited to get started.

125
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,900
Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we'll get started building up this project.
