1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,440
All right.

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,840
It's time to put all of our knowledge into action by building a project together.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,640
And we're going to use everything we learned about Flexbox to build a pricing table.

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,940
You've probably seen pricing table out on the Internet before.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:21,080
It's usually three categories small, medium, large, and it shows the customers which features they'll

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,230
get based on which tier they're going to subscribe to.

7
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,020
This is pretty much what we're going to build, although a little bit simplified.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:36,260
And the great thing about our version, because we now know about Flexbox, is we can make the width

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,500
of each of these pricing cards change dynamically based on the width that's available.

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,450
And we can also make it responsive in the way that when the window goes below a certain size, it actually

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,700
stacks these vertically rather than having them horizontally.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,630
You should have enough knowledge now to be able to complete this project.

13
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,710
Go ahead and download the starting files for our Pricing Table Project, extract it, and open it up inside

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,640
VS Code.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,550
Now, once you're here, I want you to go ahead and look inside the index.html and show it in preview.

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,640
You can see that we've got all of the HTML for you, all of the text and all of the boring parts out

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,350
of the way,

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,120
but in the CSS it's a little bit lacking.

19
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,050
The only thing I've done is I've applied a Google font called "Sono" and it gives it this fun styling

20
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,190
for our font.

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,310
Now what you're aiming for is determined by the goal-large.

22
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,120
So this is what it should look like when it's large in terms of the width of your screen and when the

23
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,780
width of your screen is small, this is what it should look like.

24
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,010
Have a think about how you might do this, how you might apply the different types of CSS styling.

25
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:03,480
So things like background or maybe a corner radius or maybe getting rid of borders around the buttons

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:11,820
or thinking about how you might use Flexbox to achieve this kind of transition from large width to small

27
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,570
width and see how far you can get.

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Again, remember, this is a project, so it's totally up to you.

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,310
You don't have to style it like this at all.

30
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,770
You can style it however you like,

31
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,700
but the most important thing is our Flexbox aspect.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:35,130
I want you to make sure that these items are inside a Flexbox so that they adapt to the width and they

33
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,100
are responsive on mobile in this case.

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,670
So when the width is very small, they get stacked up one on top of the other.

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,670
That is the very simple criteria.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,740
Everything else is totally up to you.

37
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,380
Now, there's one hint I'm going to add in here, which is a media query.

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:03:01,770
And I want you to think about what can you do using a media query and Flexbox to achieve this type of

39
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,150
responsiveness.

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,620
Pause the video and give this challenge a go.

41
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,090
Once you're done, you can come back and I'll run through my solution with you,

42
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,040
but remember, your solution is as good as mine as long as you're happy with it.

43
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,900
The important thing is to apply the skills that you've learned.

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,330
So pause the video.

45
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,530
Give that a go now.

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,430
All right.

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,020
I'm going to walk through my version of this pricing table that's in the solution.html.

48
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,290
And I'm going to walk through the code one section at a time.

49
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,390
The first section is our pricing container,

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:49,030
and this basically just applies Flexbox to each of our container items, makes it justified to the center,

51
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:55,540
so that's all grouped towards the center, and gives it a little bit of a gap between each item and sets

52
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,290
the height of the pricing container.

53
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:07,630
And then when we set the justify-content to center, align-items to center, and the height of this flexible

54
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,430
container to full height,

55
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,590
so 100vh, then it's going to make everything centered vertically and horizontally.

56
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,279
This is a really easy, almost cheats way of centering anything vertically and horizontally.

57
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,050
You might know this, you might not,

58
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:31,730
but using just normal CSS without Flexbox or Grid or one of the other frameworks is actually

59
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,420
not that simple to set something to the middle of the screen.

60
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,540
So this is an incredibly easy way of achieving that.

61
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,680
And I hope by this point you understand why it's able to do that.

62
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,720
The next thing we're going to do is to set our pricing plan.

63
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,130
Our pricing plan

64
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,810
corresponds to each of the items in our container,

65
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:01,670
and what I've done is I've set the flex to 1 so that they are equal in width and that they are allowed

66
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,680
to grow and shrink.

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:11,690
I've set the maximum width to 400 and this is probably a little bit easier to see on the full width

68
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,470
screen.

69
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,620
So that means that they don't go all the way.

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,610
And by setting that maximum width, basically I'm saying each of these cards should limit themselves

71
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,200
to that 400px size so that they don't take up the full width

72
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,520
and then our centering kind of becomes moot because it's taking up the full width.

73
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,480
And I think this just looks a little bit better in my opinion. And that's achieved using the max-width.

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Now I've added a little bit of padding inside each of these boxes just so that they're not right up

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,580
to the edge on all sides.

76
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:52,430
And I've added a sort of gray background color to differentiate it from the background.

77
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,430
I've given it a border-radius of 5px, which just makes these corners a little bit rounded,

78
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,780
which I think looks nice.

79
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,530
And I've aligned the text to the center.

80
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,960
The next four sections are pretty much all just for styling.

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,750
Let's go ahead and talk through each of them.

82
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:18,440
The "plan-title" I've made super large, so I increased the font-size, made the font-weight bold, and

83
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,070
also set a little bit of margin at bottom to move everything away from it so that it's not sticking

84
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,150
right next to it.

85
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,190
This is all personal preference.

86
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,420
It depends on your eye,

87
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,400
whatever you think is right is right.

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,840
And then I've set the "plan-price" to an even bigger size so that it's really standout, tells people what

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,020
it's all about, set it to bold, also gave it a little bit of margin at the bottom. Then I've set the

90
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,990
"plan-features" and this one you might remember from previous lessons you might not you might have to Google

91
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:59,660
for this, but essentially what it does is it gets rid of those bullet points because we've got an unordered

92
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,590
list (ul) here, and list items by default have the bullet,

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,750
if we set that list-style to none, it gets rid of it, which is really nice.

94
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,720
Then I've set the padding and margin to get rid of the default padding and margin to get them all closer

95
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,710
to each other.

96
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:23,150
And finally, I've added a small margin-bottom at the bottom of this section so that it pushes the button

97
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,530
down a little bit.

98
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:34,070
And then I added some styling to the button, which turns it orange, makes the text white, makes the

99
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,880
border 5px, have the curved edges,

100
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,880
and then I got rid of the border, which is this sort of black or gray default thing, which I don't

101
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,750
really like the look of,

102
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,140
so I can set that border to simply none.

103
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:55,670
Now the final thing, which is quite interesting and I don't know if this is something that you actually

104
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:02,000
realized you could do, but this combines a lot of the things that we learned previously, which is

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,520
the use of a media query.

106
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:13,970
I said that when the width of the screen is under 1250px, I'm going to target the pricing container,

107
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,570
which remember is our Flexbox container,

108
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:24,320
and instead of having the flex-direction be a row by default, I'm going to change it to have a

109
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,000
flex-direction of column.

110
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:35,190
And what that does is when this gets under 1250px, then it goes into a vertical Flexbox, which

111
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,030
is really nice.

112
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,150
It makes more use of the space.

113
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:47,130
And I've set that height to 100% because remember previously, we had the height set to 100 viewport height,

114
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:54,510
which means the height of our container is going to try and be as high as our viewport, which is only

115
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:02,850
the space that we have here now because we have more content than viewport height, it's actually better

116
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,840
to set it to 100% so that it's not limited.

117
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,680
And I'll show you what happens if I don't have this.

118
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,180
You'll see that it's actually not quite right.

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,140
When you scroll to the top and the bottom, it actually cuts off a bunch of stuff.

120
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,790
That's the one final sort of modification that I've got.

121
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,600
I hope you managed to get somewhere close to this,

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,560
and if not, don't worry, be sure to review some of the previous content, like the lesson on media

123
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,030
queries or the lesson on Flexbox sizing, and just make sure that you understand at least all of the

124
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,590
code in the solution code and you understand what's going on.

125
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,350
It doesn't matter if you didn't manage to style it exactly the same.

126
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,180
You know, a lot of this stuff is kind of personal preference and maybe you've made something that's

127
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,160
even better than what I've got here.

128
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,060
If you have,

129
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,000
be sure to share a screenshot in the Q&A section,

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,460
I would love to see what you guys have created.

131
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,870
That's all from me for this section and I'll see you in the next section.
