1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,630
All right, so hopefully you gave that challenge a good go and you managed to get the correct solution

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,990
abiding by all of the rules. Now the rules are there because we want to test your understanding of

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,620
variables.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,370
And this particular exercise is something that you often see in coding interviews where they're trying

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,770
to test a candidate's thinking process, how they go about reasoning, using code.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,040
So let's go through the solution together and see if you got it right. Now, as I mentioned previously,

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,280
we're not allowed to change any of the existing code

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,940
so the solution can't just be us changing this from 3 to 8 and that from 8 to 3.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,240
This is wrong.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,480
The second rule is we're not allowed to type any numbers.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,330
So we can't just simply say, well, a now equals 8 and b now equals 3.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,750
This is also wrong because it breaks the second rule.

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,890
Now, the last rule is we're not allowed to re-declare the variables

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:07,710
a and b. So finally, we can't say a = "8" and variable b = "3".

15
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,220
In this case, we've actually just created two new variables

16
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,040
and you can see we're getting a little warning on the side and it says that a is already defined, b

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
is already defined up here, so we can't re-declare them.

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,920
So given all of those constraints, how do we arrive at the answer?

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,730
Well, as I showed you earlier on, it's really useful to think about it in terms of real objects to

20
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,990
understand the logic.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,530
Now, we said that we've got two variables, right? a and b, and we can imagine them as two buckets,

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,490
bucket a and bucket b.

23
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,930
Now a contains sand and b contains water.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,450
How would we switch the contents of the buckets around so that a holds water and b holds sand?

25
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:58,260
Well, if this was a real-life situation, then the simplest way is probably just getting hold of another

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,710
bucket,

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,060
right?

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,190
And this is exactly the same solution that we're going to implement using code as well.

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,960
So always remember that coding is not the hard part, remembering what the semicolons are, the equals

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,169
sign,

31
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,620
this is all very easy.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,170
The difficult part is getting the logic in the first place.

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,020
So let's create this variable c and let's get it to hold some of the content that's currently inside

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,740
a.

35
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,650
And now that a is freed up, we can use a to hold what's inside b and finally we can get b to hold what

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,060
is inside c, which is what was previously inside a.

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,680
So now let's go ahead and test our code.

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,220
So I'm just going to copy these three lines and I'm going to paste it inside here.

39
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,020
And when I hit run, you can see that now a is 8 and b is 3.

40
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,160
And just these three lines of code allowed us to do the bucket switch.

41
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,010
And if we click check solution, then everything should pass and we should be allowed to continue.

42
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:05,610
So how did you get on with this challenge? If you got really stuck and you don't understand why the solution

43
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,500
is the way it is, then I urge you to just think about the buckets.

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,940
Think about how you would do it in real life,

45
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,450
what is the logic of switching the contents between a and b around when you have a bucket c and then

46
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,790
the code is going to become a lot more easily understood.

47
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,260
So if you need a moment, pause the video and have a think about it.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,690
And once you're ready, head over to the next lesson.
