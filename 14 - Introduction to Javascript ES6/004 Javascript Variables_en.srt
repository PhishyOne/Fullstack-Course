1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,080
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,939
So we've been hanging out for a little while now but let me formally introduce myself.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:09,260
My name is Angela and I live in London.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,680
My greatest ambition in life is to eat my own body weight in sushi.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,309
Now I want you to commit this to your memory.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,380
This truly is the first step towards our wonderful blossoming friendship because instead of politely

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,600
asking you ‘Do you know anyone else called Angela who lives in London?’,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,049
I can now ask you ‘Do you know anyone else with my name who lives in my city?’,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,400
or ‘Do you know anyone else who has the same ambitions as me?’.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,590
This means that whenever I want to talk to you about my name, location or ambitions, I don't have to repeat

11
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,510
myself and tell you the information that you've already committed to memory.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:50,610
So this is the same reason why we have something called variables in programming. In the same way that

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,840
you've committed my name to your memory,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,430
we can commit pieces of data to the memory of the computer, but first we need to enable the user to enter

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,650
a piece of information.

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,060
So let's learn about the prompt keyword.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,230
Now if you open up Chrome and go to our Developer Tools, we're going to head into our Sources to work

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,970
inside Chrome Snippets.

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,820
Now inside the same index.js, it's just a blank file at the moment, and I want you to write a

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,150
prompt that asks the user ‘What is your name?’.

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,390
And now if I hit command enter or control enter on Windows, or simply just click over here, then it will run

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,250
my code and it will show me a prompt.

23
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,340
Now a prompt is pretty much identical to an alert or a pop up,

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,820
but in this case it actually allows the user to input something, namely a piece of text.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,930
So I'm going to tell it that my name is Angela.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,780
So what happened to that piece of data?

27
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,700
How can I retrieve it back?

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,330
What exactly just happened?

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,890
Well, nothing.

30
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,840
It's not committed to memory,

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,030
so that piece of information is just out there in the air and it's lost.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,740
So how can we remember it?

33
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,919
Well we can use something called a variable.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,650
So for example I can write something like var

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,080
myName is equal to the string

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,590
that’s ‘Angela’.

37
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:27,490
So now if I hit run and I go into the console and type myName and hit enter, then it will know that

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,610
myName is equal to the string

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,870
‘Angela’, because I've saved this piece of data inside a variable.

40
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,450
Now let's take a look at variables in more detail.

41
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,880
This is what the syntax looks like.

42
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,040
The first word var is a keyword, and just as alert is a keyword or prompt is a keyword,

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,690
This tells us that we are creating a new variable, creating a new data container, and that container has

44
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,100
the name of whatever it is that we give it here.

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:07,030
In this case we called it myName. And then we set that variable to be equal to the value which is the

46
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,490
string ‘Angela’.

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:15,630
Now every time we refer to myName, the computer knows that we're talking about the string ‘Angela’.

48
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,630
So let's dissect the syntax a little bit more and see what's happening behind the scenes.

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,380
So whenever the computer encounters the keyword var it essentially knows that it has to construct a

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,340
new container or a new box, and this box gets given a name,

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,730
whatever it is that we put after the word var, and in this case we call it myName.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Now after the equal sign is what we're going to place inside the box and in this case it's the string

53
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,230
that's ‘Angela’.

54
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,530
And now we get to the end.

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,910
There's a semi-colon.

56
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:53,140
We finished our line of code and that box has a lid placed on it.

57
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,280
Now the special feature of a var, and why it's called a var, is because it stands for the word variable.

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,500
So that means you can vary the data that you keep inside it.

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:11,290
So, in the next instance, if I decide that I didn't really like my name, and I wanted to change it, then

60
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,560
I can tap into that same container, by writing its name,

61
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,370
in this case myName, and I can set it equal a new value. And what that means is that the computer will

62
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,930
find the box that has the name of myName.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,080
It’ll take out the content that's currently contained and delete it, and then it will reassign it a new

64
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,190
value depending on what I wrote on the right hand side of the equal sign.

65
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,020
And with that line of code I varied what's contained inside my box.

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,550
Notice that in this case I don't have to repeat the keyword var again.

67
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:52,900
The word var is only used when you're constructing a new box to contain your data or when you’re constructing

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,980
a new variable.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,890
When you decide to use the variable or when you decide to change the variable you don't need to use

70
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,280
that keyword var anymore.

71
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,770
It only needs to occur once in the lifetime of your variables.

72
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,860
Now we know that we've saved this piece of data into the variable that's called myName. As a challenge,

73
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:20,320
I want you to create an alert that shows the content of this variable but you're not allowed to type

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,370
any strings.

75
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,800
Pause the video and see if you can figure it out.

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,760
All right.

77
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,200
So this shouldn't be too hard.

78
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,470
We already know how to write alerts.

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,760
We just simply write the alert keyword,

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,950
we open some parentheses, and inside we place whatever it is that we want to be displayed inside the

81
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,720
alert.

82
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,540
And in this case we want to show the data that's contained inside the variable myName.

83
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,880
So all we have to do is to refer to the name that we gave that variable,

84
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:58,060
in this case it's myName, and we can now hit run. And you can see that ‘Angela’ gets printed because that is

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,740
the value that’s contained inside this variable or inside this box.

86
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,810
So it's like going to a shelf where you've got lots of storage boxes and pulling out the box that's

87
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,420
labeled myName to discover what's contained inside, which is the string

88
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:18,760
‘Angela’. Now, in the same way, we can save the information that the user inputs to our web site.

89
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:26,760
So, for example, we know that myName is equal to ‘Angela’. But what if we used a prompt to ask the user

90
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,180
‘What is your name?’.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,470
Now, unlike the last time, we're not going to lose this piece of information. We’re going to keep it inside

92
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,530
a variable. And that variable, we're going to give it a name, and we can call it anything we want.

93
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,480
But let's think of something that makes sense.

94
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,320
How about yourName?

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,430
And so now you're creating a new variable that's called yourName, and the value of this variable is

96
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,340
equal to whatever the user types into the prompt.

97
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,040
So now let's hit run and here's my prompt, ‘What is your name?’.

98
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,420
So let's say that my name is now Jack Bauer,

99
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,190
my favorite person in the world.

100
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,320
And hit

101
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,060
OK.

102
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:15,130
Now, if I go into the console and I type yourName, and hit enter, the computer knows the value that's

103
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,890
associated with that variable

104
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,550
is ‘Jack Bauer’.

105
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:26,320
So now we can create an alert that combines the values of both of those variables. So we can write, alert

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,310
"My name is " + myName, as the variable, + 

107
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,020
", welcome to my course " +,

108
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,920
the second variable, which is yourName, +, finally,

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
maybe an exclamation mark.

110
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,850
And now we close off that line of code with a semi-colon and I don't need these two lines of code anymore

111
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,730
because that data has already been committed to the memory of the computer, so I can delete that.

112
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,490
And now if I hit run, then you can see that it's created this message,

113
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,300
'My nanme is Angela,

114
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:08,770
welcome to my course Jack Bauer!'. So you can see that it's substituted these two places

115
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:15,760
for the value that's been stored inside myName and yourName, and it's able to create this message without

116
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,610
me having to explicitly say what these two things are.

117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,910
So, in this lesson, I wanted to introduce you to the power of variables, and how we can use it to store pieces

118
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,730
of data,

119
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,710
so we don't have to repeat ourselves and we can refer back to it later in the rest of our code.

120
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,620
And, on a more practical level, you might have a case where you create a variable that's called gameLevel,

121
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,440
and you set it equal to 1 to begin with,

122
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,310
and then, as the user goes through the levels, then you can change the value of gameLevel each time.

123
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:58,030
So say they complete the first level, then you can change this thing, gameLevel, to 2, and then you can

124
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,150
keep changing this as they progress.

125
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,160
And whenever you or the user wants to find out which level, then you can simply use an alert and say

126
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,700
show the gameLevel.

127
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:15,130
Now you'll see 3, or, if you want to make it more fancy, then you can add a string that says "Your level

128
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,770
is currently: " + gameLevel.

129
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,010
So you see that your level is currently: 3.

130
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,880
Now I hope you enjoyed this lesson. In the next lesson,

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,110
we're going to look at some of the rules around how you should name your variables.

132
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,100
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
