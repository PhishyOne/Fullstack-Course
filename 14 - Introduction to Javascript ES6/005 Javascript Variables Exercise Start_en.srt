00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,410
All right guys, in the next lesson, I've got a coding exercise for you, and it's meant to test

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,730
your understanding of JavaScript variables.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,450
Now, when you head over to the next lesson, you'll find a section with the instructions at the top

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,490
and your code file at the bottom.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,720
Now, the goal is to switch the values that are held in two variables around.

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,890
So to begin, we have a variable a which holds the value 3 and the variable b which holds the

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,830
value 8.

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,350
Now you have to write some code on lines 7, 8 and 9 so that the values are switched around,

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,730
so that a holds 8 instead and b holds 3.

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,190
The way I like to think about it is let's say you had two buckets, right? Bucket a and bucket b. A

11
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,420
holds some sand and B holds some water.

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,210
How would you get the contents of these two buckets to switch around?

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,600
That's basically your goal for this challenge.

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,379
But there's a couple of rules that you have to follow in order to get the correct answer.

15
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,600
Now, first, you should not change any of the existing code.

16
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,750
So don't touch this part and don't touch this part.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,660
You are just allowed to write in these three lines.

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,220
Now, the second rule is you're not allowed to type any numbers.

19
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,890
You can't just simply say, well, a = 8 and b = 3.

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,680
This is not a valid solution.

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,810
Now, the final rule is you're not allowed to redeclare the variables either.

22
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,220
So you can't, for example, just say, well, now a= "8" and b = "3".

23
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,090
This is also wrong.

24
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,350
So have a think about how you can solve this challenge given all of these constraints.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,610
And over here, I've got a code playground's set up for you.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,310
So when you click on it, you should be taken to the same file where you can write your code and you

27
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,690
can use this playground to test out your code.

28
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,979
So, for example, at the moment, if I just click run, then it's going to log that a is 3 and

29
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,060
b is 8.

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,540
Now, what we want to happen is when we hit run, it should say the opposite.

31
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,440
a is 8 and b is 3.

32
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:24,070
So have a play around with the code and use the Repl.it to test out your code and your hypotheses and

33
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,190
hit run to see if it actually does what you expect it to.

34
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,500
And then once you think you've got the solution, then go ahead and write them in your code file here

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,170
and you can click on Check Solution to see if you got the answer right. Now

36
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,000
once you're done, you can click, continue and I'll talk you through the solution code.

37
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,960
So head over to the next lesson and start the code challenge.
