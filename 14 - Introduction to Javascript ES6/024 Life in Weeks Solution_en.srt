1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,450
All right, so this was a relatively simple exercise, but I'm going to quickly go through the solution

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,540
in case you got stuck and you wanted to see how it's done.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,390
So the goal is very simple.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:19,410
We want to be able to output this exact sentence, replacing the x, y and z with the actual number

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,400
of days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,450
So in this case, our age is going to be passed in as an input to this function lifeInWeeks, and

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,550
we're going to be able to use it to do all of these calculations.

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,340
So here it tells us that we're assuming there's 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,780
in a year.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,630
So we can use this information to calculate the days, weeks and months remaining.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,610
So let's go ahead and do that.

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,810
We're saying that we're assuming that we'll live until 90.

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,300
So let's create a variable called yearsRemaining that's going to be set to 90 - age.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,230
Now, once we've got the years remaining, then we can work out the number of days, weeks, and month

15
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,590
left.

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:12,000
So days = yearsRemaining * 365.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,640
weeks = yearsRemaining

18
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:27,020
multiplied by 52. And finally months = yearsRemaining * 12.

19
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,990
So now that we've got all of our numbers, days, weeks and months and make sure that we haven't made

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,820
any typos anywhere, then we're ready to go ahead and console-log the output.

21
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:44,360
So I'm going to go ahead and type out this message, trying to make sure that I don't make any typos

22
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,160
and have the same capitalization.

23
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,730
So you have x days, y weeks and z months left.

24
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,840
Full stop.

25
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:02,270
So this is what I'm going to try and output and I'm going to replace each of these with the actual calculated

26
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,920
values.

27
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:09,590
So I'm going to delete the x, add some double quotes and then use some plus signs so that I can actually

28
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:15,290
concatenate the actual value of days. And then I'm just going to do this for the other parts.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,000
So now that I think I've completed my code, I'm going to click on this link to go to my Repl.it playground

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,450
and I'm going to paste my code inside this function.

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,500
So now we can go ahead and call this function lifeInWeeks and pass in our actual age.

32
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,740
Let's say I am 12 and then we can click on Run to see if it actually works.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,980
So if I was 12 years old, 90 - 12 is going to be equal to 78.

34
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,980
So the days remaining will be 78 multiplied by 365, which is twenty-eight thousand four hundred and

35
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,760
seventy.

36
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,160
The weeks remaining will be 78 multiplied by 52, which is 4,056.

37
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:12,690
And finally, the month remaining will be 78 multiplied by twelve, and that's 936

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,480
months.

39
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,370
So now that I've assured myself that my functions are working, I can go back and go ahead and click

40
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,630
on check solution.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:30,450
And hopefully as long as my sentence matches the exact example output including all the spaces and

42
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:37,410
the capitalizations and all of the commas and full stops, then my solution should pass and I should

43
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,830
have completed this challenge.

44
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,230
So how did you get on? If you got stuck

45
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,280
go back to it and try to fix it so that it works.
