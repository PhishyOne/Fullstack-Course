00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,950
Hey you've completed another module.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,580
Well done for that.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,470
Now today I want to talk about the idea of having a routine and building a routine because when you

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,980
have a routine that's really helpful.

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,250
It means that you don't have to think so much about what do you have to do at each point of the

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,700
day.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,000
So for example I have a morning routine, I actually have a daily routine which I try to stick to as much

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,910
as I can unless I'm traveling or I'm speaking or I'm teaching. So I tend to wake up around the same time about

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,450
7:30. And as soon as I wake up I jump out of bed,

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,740
I brush my teeth and I go for a walk.

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,550
Just getting some air into my brain.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,750
For some reason I feel like just like I suffocate while I sleep or something, but moving along, getting the

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,380
blood flowing, getting some air into my lungs and then after like about a half an hour walk, I come back

14
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,880
and I try to do something difficult.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:11,020
The first thing that I do during the day is usually something that I want to put off,

16
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,440
I don't really want to do

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,220
but it's something important, right?

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,150
It's not like you know like paying bills or taxes or something.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,730
I mean those things do have to be done

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:29,170
but not like as important as building towards your goal or doing something that's going to further where

21
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,040
you are right now.

22
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:38,110
So I try to get that most disliked thing done first thing because once I've gotten that done then I have

23
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:44,740
this huge sense of achievement and if it's something that takes many days to do I'll try to get in at

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,820
least an hour of it.

25
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,100
So for you if you're learning to code and even putting off like a difficult module or difficult concept

26
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,740
or something you've been meaning to read up on but you just can't bring yourself to do it,

27
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,900
do that thing first thing in the morning.

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,240
And once you've gotten over that hurdle you'll feel so proud of yourself 

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,100
having done like the hardest thing of the day.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,389
Everything else you'll just be able to knock out

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,870
easier. So

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,210
have a try at that trick. And have a think about what you want your daily routine to be like.

33
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,510
See if you can structure your morning and your day so that you don't have to think about it, but it

34
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,940
just happens automatically.

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,030
Let me know what your routines are and what has helped you.

36
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,150
And I hope that this will also help you build up towards a habit of learning to code every day.
