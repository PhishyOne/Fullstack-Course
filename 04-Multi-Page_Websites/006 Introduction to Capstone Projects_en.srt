00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:01,700
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:07,070
In this section, we'll be the first time you will be creating a Capstone Project.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:13,220
So before we get started, I want to quickly tell you what exactly are the capstone projects and why

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,090
they're so important in your journey of becoming a web developer?

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,870
As a professional web developer, the most important thing I want to know about you is what you have

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,530
done.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,830
Many web developers, for example, in this case, Matt Farley, a professional web developer and designer,

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,130
on his personal website, you'll be able to see his recent work, and this shows off the projects that

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,380
he's worked on, the clients he's worked with,

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,050
and also it means that anybody who's looking to hire him will be able to see exactly what he's made

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:45,440
of.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:49,010
This is what we are building towards now.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,950
Whenever I interview web developers or other programmers for any sort of job, one of the most important

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,890
thing I look for is their portfolio.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,090
What have they built?

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,690
What does their code look like?

17
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,070
What are they able to do?

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,480
And this is a really important step in your evolution as a developer.

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,640
You need to be able to show people what you're capable of and what better way than to start building

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,840
a portfolio.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,420
Previously you already come across GitHub and hopefully, you've already got an account on there, and this

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,240
is where we're going to be starting our portfolio

23
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,000
just like any other professional developer.

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,880
On your profile in GitHub, you will be able to pin and highlight some of the projects that you've built,

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,500
and this is where your portfolio is going to start to evolve.

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,320
Now another really neat thing about GitHub is you can see a developer's activity level, you can see

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,740
how often they've been uploading stuff to GitHub as a proxy for how often they're working and writing

28
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,280
code.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,670
So this is another great way of telling how active a programmer is and how much they're practicing and

30
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,110
polishing their skills.

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,870
In the coming lessons, you're going to see an instruction for the Capstone project and the great thing

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,570
about these capstone projects is I've created them so that they are perfectly suited for your current

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,320
level.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,760
I know exactly what you've learned because I've just taught it to you and the project specifications

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,620
reflect this, so it should be doable at your level.

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,780
Now that doesn't mean it's not hard.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,910
There will be difficulties that you'll encounter and you will have things that you might want to look

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,870
up on the internet.

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,280
Maybe you'll need to look through the docs and you'll probably struggle at some point along the way.

40
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,310
That is the idea of the Capstone project.

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,400
But in addition, in the instructions you'll always see an example website that I've created to show

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,190
you what it is you're aiming for.

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:47,010
Now, the important thing here is you don't just straight up copy the example website because remember

44
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,270
this course is taken by millions of people across the entire web

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,170
and I've often seen people apply to jobs under my friends' startups or other situations where I've

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,190
seen in their portfolio projects that are clearly from a tutorial.

47
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,560
And I know that because they're one of my tutorials.

48
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,670
So keep this in mind when you're building your capstone project.

49
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,250
And the reason why these capstone projects can be added to your portfolio is because it's going to be

50
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,080
entirely your work.

51
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,750
The specifications are there as if you're a professional developer, getting the instructions from your

52
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,260
clients.

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,610
So ideally, everyone's work will be completely different.

54
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,610
And unlike the course projects where I provide solution code, where I provide walkthrough videos,

55
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,310
where we go through every part of the project in detail together, I give you the designs to create

56
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,790
it,

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,920
I show you exactly what it needs to look like, all the images and files that you require in order to

58
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,550
build it,

59
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,150
the capstone projects are a different concept, and the easiest way to imagine is you've now graduated

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,840
from Web Developer Bootcamp and you're now ready to take on a client.

61
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:00,660
Your client is going to give you a specification for what you need to create and you're going to create

62
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,190
it as a professional.

63
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,180
No copying of other people's code and no instructor to lean on.

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,040
And hopefully through these capstone projects you'll see your own personal evolution.

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,769
What you're able to build at Capstone one is going to be very different from Capstone Six and so on,

66
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,540
and this is a great way of getting used to working as a professional developer.

67
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,870
Now, if you don't ever want to get a job as a developer, then feel free to skip this module entirely

68
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,580
and continue learning.

69
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,400
It's only useful if you find it useful.

70
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,240
It's not for my benefit, but I do think that it's really important to get out of what's called tutorial

71
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,480
hell, where you are relying heavily on tutorials.

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,420
You need to be able to feel the struggle and to do things by yourself in order to evolve and get better

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,330
as a programmer and as a developer.

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,740
All right, enough said,

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,160
it's time to move on to the next lesson and take a look at the instructions for your first capstone

76
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,940
project.

77
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,070
I hope you enjoy it and be sure to share your good work in the Q&A once you're done.
