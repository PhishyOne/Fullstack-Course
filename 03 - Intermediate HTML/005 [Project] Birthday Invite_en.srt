1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,490
All right.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:07,060
It's time to put everything we've learned so far together and create a project.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:13,760
In this project, we're going to create a website for your next party to help you invite all your guests,

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,880
because paper invites and WhatsApp invites are only for people who can't create websites.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,230
Am I right?

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,540
We can do it better.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,400
This is what we're aiming for.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,970
We're aiming for a retro 90s look website because we haven't learned about styling websites yet, which

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,970
is yet to come, but this is already pretty nice.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:41,630
We're going to create a website to tell people that it's our birthday, which day it is, and we're

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,460
going to add some images.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,790
We're going to tell people what to bring using lists.

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,140
And also we're going to add an anchor tag to show people where they need to go.

14
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,970
Hopefully, we're going to combine a lot of the things that you've learned in previous lessons.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:01,290
And once you're ready, head over to the course resources for this lesson.

16
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,160
Download and extract the zip file in order to get started.

17
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,900
When you take a look at the index.html, you can see I've provided an example image URL and an example

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,040
Google Maps link.

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,650
So if you take a look inside the goal, you can see what the example image will take you to.

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,230
And if you're ready for an Easter egg/mini surprise, you can head over to the Google map link

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,990
and see where it's located as well.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,580
So this is a project and it's not a coding exercise.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,520
It's not something that I'm testing you on.

24
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,780
Everything I'm saying,

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,430
it's just a guideline.

26
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:47,610
I want you to at minimum, have an image in there, have a list in there, and also have an anchor tag

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,360
in there.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,120
Everything else is totally up to you.

29
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,010
You can mess around with it as much as you like or change as much as you like, or keep it as simple

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,550
as you like.

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,110
It doesn't really matter.

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,760
Pause the video and give this project a go, and happy birthday if it is your birthday today.

33
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,500
All right.

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,190
So want to walk through one possible solution?

35
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,430
I just want to say this is just one possibility.

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,680
You can change it as much as you like.

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,900
There is no right or wrong in the project,

38
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,970
i's all about practice and also your own personal style.

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,590
So in my case, I created an h1 for the top-level heading, which is the most important thing,

40
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,170
it's my birthday. And then I've got some h2's and some h3's,

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,110
so for what to bring and where you need to go. In the image tag

42
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:50,000
I've added a source to that image I provided in the starting code, and also I provided an alternative

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
text to show people what this image is all about.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,370
If you managed to get the image source and the alternative text and your image shows up, then congratulations.

45
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,600
You did a great job.

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:09,720
Now the next part I've got is an unordered list to tell people what they should bring with each item

47
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,660
in its own list item element.

48
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,790
And finally, I created an anchor tag to tell people where they need to go.

49
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,470
So I've added an href attribute and I used the link that I supplied in the starting code and I told

50
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:33,660
people that the link text is a Google map link, which hopefully will take them to where they need to

51
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,400
go, which is somewhere in Tokyo where all the pigeon people meet, apparently.

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,660
So if you found that Easter egg, then congratulations.

53
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,270
But if you're really proud of what you managed to do for your project, then be sure to take a screenshot

54
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,810
of it and post it in the Q&A to share it with the rest of us.

55
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,640
I would love to see what you came up with, but that's all from me for this section.

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,710
I hope you enjoyed learning more about HTML elements and I'll see you soon.
