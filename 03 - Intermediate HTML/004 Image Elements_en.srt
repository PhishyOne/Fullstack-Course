1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,490
Now, a website would be pretty boring if it had no images on it, right?

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:11,330
So in this lesson we're going to learn how we can add images to our website using the image element.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,430
Now this is what it looks like.

4
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,660
It's pretty simple.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,630
And you'll notice that similar to the anchor tag or the anchor element that we learned about in the

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,950
last lesson, the main component of an image tag that renders the image is this attribute, which is

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,410
called source or src.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:38,810
And what this does is it tells the image element what is the source of the image.

9
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:47,510
And that's why after the equal sign, the value is going to be the location of the image.

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:56,300
One last thing to notice about the image tag is, unlike the anchor tag, it doesn't have a closing

11
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,960
tag.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,540
Instead, it is a self closing tag, also known as a void element.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,390
Remember, previously we learned about void elements where we learnt that you can have horizontal rule

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,540
elements, you can also have break elements.

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,230
And similarly the image element is also a void element that doesn't have a closing tag.

16
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,150
Because if you think about it, what is the text content of an image?

17
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,390
Doesn't really make sense, right?

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,970
The main content is actually the image that will be rendered from the source.

19
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,800
What does this look like?

20
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:39,810
Well, here's an example image element where we've set the source to a real life live photo on the Internet.

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,940
Now, when this code is rendered in a website, it will display a random image.

22
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,570
So in this case, the random image I got was a forest.

23
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:56,430
And the reason why it's random is because I'm getting these photos from a source called picsum.photos.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,460
So if you type this into your browser, you should see a website and the idea is kind of like the Lorem

25
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,310
ipsum for placeholder photos.

26
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,220
So when you don't really care what the photo is, but you need a photo on your website as you're creating

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,070
it in order to see what it would look like, then you could use this website and you could put in the

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,390
URL, which is the standard one like here.

29
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:26,040
And then after a forward slash, you can add in the size of your image.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,640
So in this case, I'm saying I want a square that is 200 pixels by 200 pixels.

31
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,400
It gives me a random image from its data bank, for example, in this case of a forest.

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:47,160
The other attribute for an image tag that's super important and one that you should always have is the,

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,480
"alt" attribute.

34
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,820
And the alt attribute stands for Alternative Text Description.

35
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,910
This is really important because people who are blind or visually impaired, they don't look at the

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,440
Internet the same way we do.

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,780
They often use something called a screen reader.

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,830
And what the screen reader is going to do when it hits an image is it will look at the alternative text

39
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,760
provided.

40
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,460
So in this case, I've provided that this is a forest at sunset or sunrise.

41
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:22,830
I'm not quite sure, but that means that the person with visual impairment will get this read out to

42
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,760
them and it will help them understand what the website's all about.

43
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,400
So what is this process like?

44
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,840
As an example, I'm using the Silktide Toolbar, which is a Chrome browser extension, to simulate what

45
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,530
a person with visual impairment might hear as they're browsing,

46
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,420
in this case, the BBC website.

47
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,300
As I click through next, you can see it describes the different things that are on screen.

48
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,670
And if I go over to the image, it describes the image for me.

49
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,740
"Item 2, Dolphin leaping from the sea - image.

50
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,470
So where is it getting this description from?

51
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,070
Well, if we right click on the image and inspect it, and if we look for the image, which I think

52
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,490
should be down here, you can see as I highlight different parts, it shows me which part.

53
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:22,350
So in this element, I'm probably going to find an image at the end right here and you can see the alt

54
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,590
text saying, "Dolphin leaping from the sea."

55
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,630
And that is what gets read out from the screen reader helping somebody with blindness

56
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,570
be able to understand what's on this website.

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,860
Now, if you want to check out this tool, it's a Chrome browser extension called Silktide and it should

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,030
be a free plugin, but it might only work on Mac or certain versions of Windows, but it's not so much

59
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,590
about the tool, but I wanted to show you how important it is the alt text that you provide for accessibility

60
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,620
and for disabled users browsing your website.

61
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,730
Now let's try

62
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,930
an exercise and create some images of our own.

63
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Download the zip file from this current lesson and go ahead and drag it into your Web Development Project

64
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,400
folder and open it inside VS Code.

65
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:21,110
If you take a look inside the index.html, you can see I've provided to you two image URL examples that

66
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,320
you can use.

67
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:28,610
And what we're aiming for is to find out if you're a cat person or if you're a dog person.

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,430
I want you to create a h1 that says, "I'm a cat person," or "I'm a dog person."

69
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,350
And also I want you to add an image element straight afterwards.

70
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,970
Now, you can use the URL for the dog or for the cat.

71
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,960
It doesn't really matter at the end of the day, as long as you've understood how to create images.

72
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,640
That's the challenge.

73
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,760
Pause the video and give that a go.

74
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:58,680
All right.

75
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,280
So personally, I'm more of a dog kind of person.

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,680
And if you're also a dog person, then you might see my little Easter egg that I've buried in there.

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:16,570
So first, let's go ahead and create our h1, and then we're going to create our image.

78
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:22,530
Remember, we create an image tag and it's a self-closing tag.

79
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:33,630
Then we add in our source as the image source, and we're going to put our URL right inside there.

80
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,650
Now, already, if we go ahead and show preview, you can see our little dog digging in the sand

81
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,350
because if you've noticed, this is actually a gif image.

82
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,200
GIF images work exactly the same way as normal images, JPEGs or PNGs.

83
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,780
As long as you put it into the source, it will be rendered in a website and it will start animating

84
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,990
all by itself.

85
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,810
And you get a cute little dog digging through the sand.

86
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,500
Now if you're a cat person, then this is just a static jpeg because cats are more chill.

87
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,880
So I hope you managed to get that part right.

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,530
But we haven't finished creating our image element yet.

89
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,530
Remember what I said about the alt tag?

90
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,990
It's a good idea to always add an alt tag to describe our image when we can.

91
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,990
Now, there are some cases where you don't create an alt tag because it's not really relevant to somebody

92
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,400
reading through the content of a website and you can in fact leave it blank.

93
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,710
But in this case, it's very simple,

94
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,630
we've got a puppy who is digging through the sand.

95
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,970
And now when we take a look at our preview, then nothing visually for us changes.

96
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,550
But behind the scenes, we will help our visually impaired friends to be able to understand our website

97
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,900
just a little bit better.

98
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,310
So I hope you managed to achieve either of these goals.

99
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:09,130
And once you're ready, we can head over to the next lesson where we've got the final project to create

100
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,410
a birthday invite website using all the skills that we've learned so far.

101
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,250
So all of that and more,

102
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,110
I'll see you there.
