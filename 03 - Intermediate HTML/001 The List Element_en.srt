00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,250
Hey guys.

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,320
In the previous lesson, you've learned a lot about different types of HTML elements and you already

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,960
got started using them to create websites.

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,670
Now in this section we're going to take it a little bit further and explore some more intermediate and

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,770
advanced concepts in HTML.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,320
We're going to get started in this lesson by learning about list elements, the ordered and unordered

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,070
lists.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:27,170
Now, if you've spent any time around on the Internet recently, you'll notice that it's completely

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,520
full of lists.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:36,020
If you go on to BuzzFeed or any of these sort of clickbaity articles, usually they'll create a list

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,300
of something such as great items that must have been invented by geniuses.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,660
But also if you look at something like the, "FBI's ten Most Wanted Fugitives," this is also created in

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,700
this website using a list.

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,690
So how do we create these lists ourselves?

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,080
Well, let's start off with one of the most common types, the unordered list.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,260
And it's super simple to create simply, you have a starting tag with ul and then have a closing tag.

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,880
Now, normally we've had one line elements such as this where we get to add some content in between

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,730
the opening and closing tags.

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,920
Now in this case, however, it's a little bit different.

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,940
They actually go on separate lines because in between these two opening and closing tags, we need an extra

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,600
type of tag in order to complete this unordered list.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,570
And these are called list items.

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:38,730
So here you can see we've got three list items and each of them contain some piece of content.

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,270
But all three items are enclosed inside this unordered list.

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,850
So for any list to work and display content, then you're going to have to add list items into it.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,150
So what does this look like if we actually run the code?

27
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,770
Well, this is what you would see.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:03,420
Essentially unordered list items will create these bullet points, because such as in the case of a shopping

29
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,190
list here, the order of the items doesn't matter.

30
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,970
So that's why an unordered list would be perfect for this situation.

31
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,200
However, on the other hand, if you needed your list items to be arranged in a particular order, then

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,060
you would create an ordered list.

33
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,570
And once you've added the list items inside there, what this will do is it will give you numbers.

34
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:35,700
So it would start from one and the number next to each list item will depend on the order that you put

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,420
into this ordered list element.

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,960
If this milk was down here, then it would get the number three and so on and so forth.

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,530
That's all pretty simple.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:54,990
So if we compare the ordered list, the ol element that gives us numbers and versus the ul, the unordered

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,830
list item, which just gives us bullet points, simple as that.

40
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,310
And coming back to our "FBI ten Most Wanted Fugitives" website, you can see they actually created this

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,230
website using lists.

42
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,160
So when you right click on any of these images and select inspect, you can see that each of these photos

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,170
are actually a list item placed inside an unordered list.

44
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,910
Now there's a whole bunch more to this website which we're going to learn in future lessons,

45
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:30,060
but the really important thing is for you to see that this is a really important part that you see in

46
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,100
websites all over on the Internet.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,280
So it's really important that we understand how to use them.

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,490
So now that we've learned a little bit about ordered and unordered lists, let's try an exercise to

49
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,680
make sure that you've understood everything.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Go ahead and download, "The list element" zip file from this current lesson.

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,000
And as always, if you forget how to do that, or if you just started on this lesson, then I recommend

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,860
going to one of the earlier lessons where I show you, "How to download course resources."

53
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,830
Now, once you've downloaded and extracted the folder, 3.0 List Elements and dragged it into VS Code

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,860
or your web development projects folder, then you should be able to see it here on the file Explorer

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,790
on the left.

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:24,420
If we explore some of the files for this current coding exercise, you can see we've got an index.html

57
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,280
that contains some plain text which you're going to be formatting into lists.

58
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,330
And if we take a look at the goal, feel free to choose whichever heading sizes you want.

59
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:43,830
But for me, I think it made the most sense to have one h1 and then the ingredients and the instructions

60
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,850
as h2's and then any other headings like this part and this part as h3's.

61
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,730
But the most important thing I care about in this exercise, is you manage to create these lists.

62
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,690
So we've got an unordered list for the

63
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,110
Section 1 of the ingredients to create the dough.

64
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,460
And then we've got another unordered list for the filling ingredients.

65
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,550
And finally, we've got all the rest of the instructions as an ordered list.

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,710
Think about how you're going to create this and don't worry about typing all the text out because if

67
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,510
you look inside the index.html, you'll see all the text typed out for you already.

68
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,830
All you need to do is to add the HTML tags and to format the document into an HTML website.

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,640
And in the end we should end up with this recipe website for creating delicious cinnamon rolls.

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,120
Now, if you watched my recent Instagram takeover of the Udemy account, you'll see me making the same

71
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,110
cinnamon rolls

72
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,920
and if you want to do the same, then this is the recipe for you.

73
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,200
This is what you're aiming for and using what you've learnt about list elements.

74
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,550
I want you to go ahead and pause the video and complete this challenge.

75
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,040
All right.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,510
So did you manage to do that?

77
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,970
Let's go ahead and walk through the solution together.

78
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,610
So I'm going to show you the preview on the right side so you can see the website update as I type.

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,670
First, we're going to start off with our heading tags.

80
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,850
So I'm just going to add a bunch of headings in quite quickly.

81
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,800
All right, so that's all the headings out of the way.

82
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,320
So now we're on to the proper work, which is creating our lists.

83
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,810
As I said, the ingredients don't really need an order, so we're going to create an unordered list.

84
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,740
So in between our start and end ul tags, we're going to have each of these as a list item.

85
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,980
So I'm going to create the list item tag.

86
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:55,650
And once I've created that, then all I need to do is to drag my first list item in between the list

87
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,360
item.

88
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,440
Now, if clicking and dragging doesn't work for you, if this doesn't show up, then you can also just

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,190
right click, copy and paste, that also works.

90
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:12,580
Now I need to do this many times, so for efficiency's sake, I'm just going to paste in another 4 or

91
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:20,100
5 of these and drag in all of the other ingredients into each of these list items.

92
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,340
Now, when you're actually coding this from scratch, you won't need to do all of this dragging because

93
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:33,020
you'll be typing your list item and then you'll be writing your item name in here like so.

94
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:38,790
But because we've written all the text for you, hopefully to save you some time so that you're actually

95
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,040
doing more coding and less sort of busy work, then this is how we do it.

96
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,780
Again For The filling,

97
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,900
we've got another unordered list and then inside there are three list items.

98
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:59,820
So let me go ahead and paste those three list items in and drag each of them in between the tags like

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,450
so.

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,040
So now we've got our ingredients and we've got our two unordered lists showing up perfectly.

101
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,530
Now all we have to do is to create the final list, which is going to be an ordered list, because if

102
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,200
you think about it, instructions have an order, right?

103
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,370
You can't first bake the thing if you haven't created it yet.

104
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,390
Inside this ordered list, we again need these list item elements and we need to create as many of them

105
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,270
as we have steps.

106
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,370
So I'm going to drag each of the lines into the list elements.

107
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,600
And there we have it.

108
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:50,150
We've got all of our list items and all of our instructions showing up perfectly inside an ordered list.

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,530
And if we check against the goal, then you can see we've pretty much completed everything perfectly.

110
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:05,850
Now, one thing to talk about at this point is notice how some HTML elements are one line and other

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,520
HTML elements are on multiple lines.

112
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:17,010
When you paste long lines of text in between the start and end tags of an element, sometimes VS Code

113
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,970
will automatically put the closing tag onto the next line.

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,590
Now, you can edit this so that it all goes onto the same line, or you can purposely make sure they're

115
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,360
on different lines and you see it being sandwiched between the open and closing tags.

116
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:39,450
Now this is a personal preference, so it really doesn't matter how you want to do this. So you can do

117
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,810
this however you like.

118
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,310
But for me, I like to have list items all on the same line.

119
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:53,470
This just kind of helps me see visually how many list items I have, and it doesn't clutter up the list

120
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,600
with all of these list items.

121
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,080
So have a think about whether, if you like to see your elements like this all on one line with the

122
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:10,510
content enclosed or if you prefer to have it like this where things are more indented and you have the

123
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,880
content in between two lines of your list item.

124
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,320
In the next lesson, we're going to talk a little bit more about this type of indentation.

125
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,840
So don't worry if that doesn't make sense just yet.

126
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,910
We're going to talk about nesting and we're going to talk about indentation of HTML elements.

127
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,690
So once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we'll continue from there.
