1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,810
All right.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,380
So now that we're more or less done writing Motoko code and we've completed the back-end for this

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,710
decentralized finance or defi application, well, it's time to actually think about what the user is

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,250
going to see.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,950
So namely the front end of this application.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,720
Now you notice that by default, every single new project that you create on the ICP when you use

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:34,860
the template, it will generate a set of assets, including a Dfinity logo and also an index.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,870
html and index.js.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,040
And you can tell pretty much from this HTML code that this is just the same as the hello world example

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,180
that we saw when we first set up for ICP development.

11
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,740
And that means right now the frontend for our Dbank actually looks somewhat like this.

12
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,250
So this doesn't allow us to use any of the things that we've created in our back-end.

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,170
And so basically we have to get rid of the template and replace it with this.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,270
This is what we're going to create today.

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,440
We're going to hook up this front-end with our Motoko back-end and get it to actually work and to update

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:22,920
the balance to top up, to withdraw and to be able to use our Motoko code.

17
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,930
So let's get started.

18
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,330
The first thing I want you to do is to go ahead and simply just delete everything that's inside the

19
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:37,080
index.html, the main.css and also the index.js.

20
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,520
We're going to delete all three parts of our frontend basically. And instead we're going to replace

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,380
it with some new code.

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,650
Now, if you go over to the course resources for this lesson, you'll be able to download a file called

23
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,970
Index and Main.

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:03,670
Now, instead of saving them as HTML files or CSS files, I've actually gotten rid of the extension and

25
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,340
just kept them as text files. This way

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:12,100
basically, when you double click on it to open on your computer, it won't try to open it in the browser

27
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,680
because it recognizes it's an HTML file.

28
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,910
But what I want you to do is to go ahead and simply just copy the index file and put it into the index

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,900
.html.

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,460
And then do the same thing for the CSS,

31
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:36,290
so the main file goes into the main.css. And now we've got some basic front-end code.

32
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,040
Now because we've done so much front-end work in this course already when we covered HTML CSS, I don't

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,810
want to type all of this out from scratch so that we can focus more on learning new things.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,570
But I think it's a good idea always when you copy and paste code to just make sure that you understand

35
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,250
what's actually going on.

36
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,280
So in this case, all we've got here is a container that contains a logo.

37
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,560
Now, don't worry about this just yet.

38
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,990
I'm going to talk about it in just a second.

39
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,870
We're going to create this logo very soon.

40
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,350
And then you can see we've got this current balance which corresponds to this line.

41
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:23,870
And then we've got a form where we've got two inputs: a place where we can put the input amount and

42
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,760
a place where we can put the withdraw amount.

43
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,050
And then finally there's a submit button. And then the CSS basically just styles up all of those components.

44
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,600
And I've kept it pretty basic.

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,930
So now what we are going to code up, however, is the index.js. We're not just going to copy

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,360
and paste code in here because we actually have to understand how to hook up the frontend with the backend.

47
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,440
This is really important.

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,470
But what do we do if we want to be able to see this so that we can develop it as we go along?

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,890
Well, in this case, we're going to set up a new terminal.

50
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,970
And making sure that you are inside the dbank project,

51
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,090
you're going to run npm install.

52
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,420
And this is going to install all of the packages that are required for this to get up and going.

53
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,769
And if you take a look inside package.json, you can see what the dependencies are.

54
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,959
There shouldn't be too many.

55
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,320
Now, the next thing we're going to do is we're going to run dfx start.

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,340
And that means we've got our simulated Internet computer running locally.

57
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,240
And then in a new terminal, I'm going to run

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,650
dfx deploy.

59
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,050
You might have already done this before, so you might have already deployed your code into the canisters.

60
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,060
But because we've changed a whole bunch of files, it's usually a good idea to just deploy and update

61
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,810
our canisters.

62
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,890
Now, finally, I'm going to run the command npm

63
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,400
start.

64
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:54,920
And this is going to spin up our web server and it will allow us to view what our current website looks

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,160
like.

66
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,530
So as you can see, we've got a broken logo because we don't have it in yet,

67
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,450
but the CSS and HTML seem to be placed in correctly.

68
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,070
Now, none of this is going to work because of course, we don't have any JavaScript code to

69
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,930
tell it how it should behave.

70
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,540
But the first thing we need to fix is this logo. In order to add this logo,

71
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,010
I've again included it in the course resources, so you can simply download it.

72
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,620
And once you've downloaded it, all you have to do is drag and drop it into the assets folder.

73
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,220
So the same folder as where the logo.png is.

74
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,280
So let's go ahead and do that.

75
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,260
Now you can either delete this Dfinity logo or you can keep it.

76
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,650
It doesn't really matter.

77
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,280
I'm going to get rid of it just so that it's less confusing here so that we've only got one logo.

78
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,490
And you can see this is the logo that I've created for our current project.

79
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,710
If you want to create your own logo from scratch, then I'll show you how I made this.

80
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,920
I didn't actually design or do any work.

81
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,070
Instead, I use this free logo maker online.

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:13,610
I typed in the name of my product and then I just went through this selection process and chose fonts

83
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,670
and sizes and styles that I liked.

84
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,220
And then we get to pick our favorite color,

85
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:26,180
add a slogan if you want to, and then type in some related icons to our concept.

86
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,000
Now, in the end, I actually didn't choose to use a logo with any of these icons, but you might feel

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,570
differently.

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,430
So once you've chosen all of your icons, then it'll show you a bunch of automatically AI-generated logo

89
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,770
results and you can basically just go through these and pick one that you like.

90
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,860
And then once you're done, you can download it by signing up to this free service.

91
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,800
They just want an email password, I think.

92
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,070
Alternatively, if you don't want to sign up, you can also just take a screenshot of the logo that

93
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,790
you like and then crop it to the size that you want.

94
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,260
And this is how I basically ended up with this Dbank logo.

95
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,760
And then all we have to do is drag it into the assets folder and we're golden.

96
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:22,370
So now if we go ahead and hit save and go back to our local host and then go ahead and refresh, you

97
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,840
should see the logo show up.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,990
So perfect.

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,250
Now, this HTML and CSS part is at least complete.

100
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:35,290
And what we need to do now is to hook it up with the JavaScript.
