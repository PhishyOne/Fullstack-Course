1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,170
All right.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,430
We're going to get started by building our first Defi or decentralized finance app.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,610
And in the process, we're going to learn how to program for the Internet computer using the Motoko

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,170
language.

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:20,200
The project that we're going to be building is somewhat inspired by the compound protocol, which is

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,780
what's called a money market protocol. Basically compound that allows people to lend and borrow their

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,440
tokens.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,800
So, for example, people can supply their ether and earn a little bit of interest on it, or people

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,950
can borrow a token, say the chainlink token, and bet that the tokens price will have gone down by

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,420
the time they repay their loan.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,910
Essentially, compound will collect the interest paid by the borrowers and pay out that interest to

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,930
the lenders of that token while also taking a small fee for the service.

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,210
So for our first project, we're going to write the code to earn interest on a token balance in the

14
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,630
token.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,330
So what is Motoko?

16
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,480
Nope, we're not talking about Ghost in the Shell here.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,150
We're actually talking about a programming language that was designed and created by the Dfinity team,

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,700
led by Andreas Rossberg, who was one of the original co-creators of Webassembly.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:19,150
Motoko was designed to be a modern, general purpose programming language, and it's a language that

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,580
you can use specifically to create Internet computer smart contracts.

21
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,210
And as we start using it, you'll notice that there's a lot of similarities to other programming languages

22
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:38,410
that you might already know for example, JavaScript or Swift or TypeScript or C# or Java.

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:45,490
And as we start building more applications using Motoko, you can see that it's pretty easy to switch

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,820
over from whichever programming language you've learned before.

25
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,940
And hey, as programmers, there's constantly new programming languages, new programming paradigms

26
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,140
that we have to pick up on.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,490
And it's a great exercise in your program, the flexibility to be able to learn new languages quickly

28
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,330
and adapt to them.

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,630
Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and we're going to get started learning all about Motoko

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,000
and how to build our very own decentralized application on ICP.
