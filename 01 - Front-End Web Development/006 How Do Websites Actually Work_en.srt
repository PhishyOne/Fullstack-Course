00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,370
Hey, guys, it's your host, Angela, here.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,110
Welcome to another episode in your favorite show that should really be on Netflix.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,200
In this episode, we're going to learn exactly how websites actually work and understand the role of

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,300
the browser and the different files that it uses to render your favorite web pages.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,180
Previously on the Complete Web Development Boot Camp, you learned that the Internet consists of a wire

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,000
that connects Client computers with Server computers, and you learned that there are special kinds of

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,930
server computers called Domain Name Service servers, which acts as a big old Yellow Pages phonebook

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,400
and can look up the IP address of any website you want to access.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:47,430
And when you find out that IP address, you can directly hit up the server computer for the website

10
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,790
that you want to view and they'll send you all the files and data for your browser to be able to render

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,020
it on screen.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,460
Now, the data that you receive from that server usually consists of three types of files HTML, CSS,

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,600
and JavaScript,

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,820
and it's very likely that you would have come across these types of files or these words before because

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,860
they're so common and they are so integral to how websites work.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:18,570
But what exactly do they do and why are there so many different types of files?

17
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,740
Why can't we just have one file that's, you know, a website?

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,690
Well, they actually have very different jobs.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,510
So, for example, the HTML code file is responsible for the content in your website.

20
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,670
So if a website was a house, then the HTML would be the actual bricks of the house.

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,610
It's the raw materials that makes up your house.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,850
Similarly, the HTML file contains the content of your website, like the text content or the images

23
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,500
or buttons or links.

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,070
The second type of files are the CSS files, and these are responsible for styling your website like

25
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,250
the color of the walls or the shape of your door.

26
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,480
The CSS file determines how your website will look.

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,340
So what color will the background of the page be, or will the buttons have rounded corners?

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:14,060
It targets all the content in your website that you created using HTML, for example, the text or the

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,900
buttons and applies the styling to those elements.

30
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,380
So you could use CSS to make a button red and have rounded corners and the button text to have a particular

31
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,030
font.

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,170
That is what CSS is for.

33
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,710
Now the final component is the JavaScript code, and this is the code that allows your website to actually

34
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,260
do things, or have functionality.

35
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:42,350
So if you are building a house, this would be like adding light bulbs that can turn on and off or putting

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,950
in a cooker that can actually turn on a fire to heat your food.

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,920
It turns your house into a home, and the JavaScript code does exactly that for a website.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,310
It turns a static website which just has pretty images or text into something that a user can actually

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,240
interact with.

40
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,950
For example, send an email in Gmail or post your breakfast on Instagram.

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,920
It allows your website to actually do things and become functional, not just something pretty to look

42
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,130
at.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,040
So if we take the Google home page as an example, again, once we receive these three types of files

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,180
from the Google server, we can use our browser, which is a piece of software that specializes in dealing

45
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,260
with these files.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,830
So when the browser loads up the HTML will get to see the content of the website.

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,860
So in this case, there's one image which has the Google logo.

48
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,360
There's two buttons and there's a text box where we can enter our search term.

49
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:45,950
Now when the browser then loads up the CSS files, then it will modify the appearance of those components,

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,700
so we don't get any extra buttons or images or anything with the CSS, but it will now look exactly

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,770
the way Google wanted it to.

52
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,460
The shape of that text box or the color of the buttons.

53
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,280
And finally, using the JavaScript file, the browser gives us the functionality of this website.

54
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,800
So we can type in a search term like Google in 1998.

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,600
And by the way, you should really try this in Google because when you hit search, it'll turn Google

56
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,220
into what it looked like in 1998.

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,720
So with all these three different files, we get the content, we get the styling, and finally we get

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,790
the functionality of the website.

59
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,690
And combined together is how we create modern websites.

60
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Now, with all this knowledge that we've already acquired, we can already start messing around with

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,500
real websites on the internet.

62
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,090
So if you open up your browser and head over to Google.com, you can right-click on the button, which

63
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,750
is Google Search and click on Inspect.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,770
Now, what this does is it brings up the Chrome Developer Tools.

65
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,300
Now, Chrome has one of the best tool suites for web developers like us.

66
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:02,460
This is why at the beginning of the course, I asked you to download the Chrome browser, even if you

67
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,230
normally use a different browser.

68
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,760
So if you haven't yet downloaded Chrome, be sure to do it now before you continue,

69
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,750
otherwise, some of the things that I say might not work. In the coming lessons,

70
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,030
we're going to be exploring the Chrome Developer Tools in a lot more detail, but for now we're just

71
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,450
going to use it to do something really simple.

72
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,980
So you can see that Chrome Developer Tools has automatically highlighted the part of the code that's

73
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,170
responsible for that button that I right-clicked on. That I wanted to inspect.

74
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,920
And if we look carefully, you can see that the title of the button, which says, "Google Search" is actually

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,760
in here and we can find it right here.

76
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,980
Just after the word value.

77
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,000
And if we double click on it, then we can actually edit this title for it to say something completely

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,700
different.

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
So instead of Google Search, let's call it Angela Search.

80
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,820
And then once I hit enter, you'll see that update over here.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,020
Now, you'll notice there's also one called aria-label Google Search,

82
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,100
and this is actually only for text readers rather than for our browser.

83
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:12,750
You can change that too, but it just means that you won't really see it on screen.

84
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,500
It's updating something that's used behind the scenes.

85
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,740
So be sure to double-click on the correct thing.

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,900
Now, depending on what HTML content we're inspecting on, the part that we have to change might be different.

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,260
So for example, if you wanted to change the headlines on techcrunch.com, you can simply right-click

88
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,470
on one of those headlines, click, inspect and find the part that corresponds to this headline,

89
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,870
which is right here in black, and we can double-click on it to say something completely different.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:57,010
And you can actually change the front page of TechCrunch or BBC News or any website you want to.

91
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,430
So this is a great way of pranking your friends, especially when they can see that you're on techcrunch.com

92
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:08,570
and the title or any of the other pieces of text can say whatever you want it to.

93
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:14,490
And this is a great joke to play on friends who are maybe not quite as technologically advanced as you,

94
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,400
because they haven't taken the course that you have.

95
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,830
Now, unfortunately, when I hit refresh on this website, you'll see that everything gets restored

96
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,830
to the original version of the website.

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:32,610
And the reason for this is because when we hit refresh, we're asking TechCrunch's servers to deliver

98
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:41,100
us the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files once again so that we can render the website on our browser.

99
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,070
But when we edit our website in the Chrome Developer Tools, effectively what we're changing is our

100
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,480
local version,

101
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,190
and this doesn't get saved when you hit refresh.

102
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,020
So of course then the website will update to the original content.

103
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,650
But in the coming lessons we're going to be working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript so that you can create

104
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:08,520
and host your own websites, live on the Internet and through learning how to code and how to build

105
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,160
websites,

106
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,610
you're going to be able to make websites that say anything you want it to, look the way that you want

107
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,730
it to, and have the functionality that you need.

108
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,480
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
