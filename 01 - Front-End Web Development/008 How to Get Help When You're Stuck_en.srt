1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,080
All right guys.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,180
It's Angela from The App Brewery again.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:09,510
So at this stage I'm presuming that you've probably at some point in your life done a tutorial or a

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,470
lesson somewhere else out there on the Internet and inevitably at some point you'll probably get stuck

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,460
on a problem.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,890
Now I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make the course such that you get stuck less often

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,170
but with programming it’s almost a core part of the learning process that you do get stuck and you get

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,540
yourself unstuck.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,710
So I tend to find that when I get stuck on something I try to see it as a challenge because usually

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,800
when I solve it and when I figure it out there is a huge sense of satisfaction and there's usually some

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,900
associated growth.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:49,530
Now having taught over 100000 students online and offline I've seen people struggle in lots of different

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,120
ways.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,740
And I just wanted to summarize the steps that you can go through when you get stuck on any sort of programming

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,090
problem and the framework that you can use to get yourself unstuck in the quickest way possible.

16
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,420
Now the first step is to evaluate what is the expectation versus what is the reality.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:14,120
What did you expect your code to do or what did you expect to happen and what actually happened.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,310
So every time you run your code,

19
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,860
think to yourself what do I expect to happen and then see what really happened and try to figure out

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,910
what is causing the difference.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,870
Now while you're writing code it's inevitable that you will end up creating errors. And this can happen

22
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,790
when you've made a mistake or spelled something wrong or even when you're just trying to install a piece

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,270
of software. And those errors are usually accompanied by bits of text or the error message. And you can

24
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,170
see this in your browser or in your code editor.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,450
And most of the time it might seem like these error messages are written by aliens because they don't

26
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,820
seem to make any sense.

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,190
But you can quite easily figure out the human meaning in English for it by just putting it into Google

28
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,310
and you'll usually get lots of different answers as to what the cause might be and how you can fix the

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,060
problem.

30
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,190
And one of the web sites, if you don't already know about it, it's going to shortly become your very best

31
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,900
friend, and that is stackoverflow.com.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,620
So I recommend searching for any errors that you come across into Google and then heading towards the

33
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,530
Stack Overflow web sites that come up as a result.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,450
And this is exactly what real life developers do every single day.

35
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,820
And in fact I've worked in teams where we will all just go to the pub and have a drink and end the day

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,100
if Stack Overflow is no longer working.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,600
So it's all a part of the developer workflow.

38
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,970
Now if that still doesn't help, or you’re confused by the results that you're getting back, then it's a good

39
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,750
idea to re-watch some of the video up to the point when the code started breaking or it started doing

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,200
something unexpected, because in the videos there are always step by step instructions and it's really

41
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,010
important that you check to make sure that you haven't made a typo here or there or you haven't capitalized

42
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:09,240
something that shouldn't be capitalized and just re-watch the video right before when your code broke

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,960
in order to try and figure out what might have gone wrong.

44
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:19,200
Now the next step is you can check your code against my code. At the end of every tutorial module,

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,610
there is a completed project that you can download, and you can scroll through the completed code, compare

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,450
it to your own, and see if there were any typos, any errors, any mistakes, and if it helps you can even

47
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,810
copy and paste sections from the completed code into your own module just to see if that line or that

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,530
paragraph helped to fix the issue.

49
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,190
And if that still doesn't solve it then the next step is head towards the Q & A.

50
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:55,620
So, underneath every lesson there is a Q & A section, and it's a good idea to check in the lesson when

51
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,060
your app has broken to see whether if anybody else had similar issues to you. And, if you can't find anybody

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,260
with the same issues, then ask in the Q & A. But make sure that you ask your question in the lesson

53
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,810
where you're having the issue. That way it makes it much easier for other students to be able to learn

54
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,450
from your mistakes and also for me to be able to quickly identify what the problem might be.

55
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,630
And if you have a question about anything in the tutorial it's a good idea just to include the timestamp

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,810
at which it occurs in the video so I can quickly watch it and figure out what you're referring to so

57
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,700
that I can better answer your questions.

58
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:41,280
Now, when you are asking questions in the Q & A, the way to get the most helpful responses and solutions

59
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,480
is by following a four step approach.

60
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,190
So firstly, tell us, to myself and other students,

61
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,570
what did you expect to happen, then

62
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:57,060
what actually happened, and then include a screenshot of all of your code that corresponds to this situation,

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,010
and then include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors,

64
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,620
if there were any errors or if your app has crashed.

65
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,290
Now, to take a screenshot of part of the screen in Windows, all you have to do is hold down the Windows

66
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:17,320
key, Shift and S, and then you'll get these little crosshairs show up and you'll be able to take a section

67
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,410
of your screen as a screenshot, and, once you let go of the mouse, it will save this to your clipboard ready

68
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,710
to be pasted into Paint or any other application.

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,040
If that doesn't work for you be sure to just Google how to take a screenshot of part of the screen and

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,660
you'll see lots of videos that can help you with this as well.

71
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,380
If you're using a Mac computer, on the other hand, this shortcut is gonna save you a lot of time, and it

72
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,140
might be worth noting this down in your notebook. When you use Command, Shift and 4, you get this little

73
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,350
crosshair that shows up and you can start clicking and dragging the area that you want to take a screenshot

74
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:00,760
with and it will save it automatically to your desktop, which then you can upload into the Q & A area

75
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,910
for the lecture.

76
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,220
So that's just a brief step by step process on what to do and how to get help when you get stuck and

77
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,610
it's important to remember that everybody gets stuck sometimes.

78
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,060
I've spent days trying to find a bug in my code and it turns out to be just a comma that was misplaced

79
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,170
or a semicolon that was accidentally deleted, and one of the greatest joys, for me anyways, is figuring

80
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:32,980
out these problems and fixing them. So don't worry if you do get stuck. Everybody will try to help you.

81
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,470
And just remember that getting stuck and solving it is all a part of the learning journey.
