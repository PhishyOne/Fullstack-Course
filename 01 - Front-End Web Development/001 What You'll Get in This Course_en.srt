Hello and welcome to the world's best web development course.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,630
My name is Angela,

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:17,980
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's highest-rated programming

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,550
bootcamp.

5
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:25,540
To date, I've taught over a million students worldwide, in-person and online.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,330
And today I'm so excited that I have the privilege to be your instructor on this course.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,850
You're going to get access to over 55 hours of HD video content,

8
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:44,170
step by step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes and much, much more.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,450
This course is created with the same curriculum as our 12-week in-person programming BootCamp. So that

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:01:00,220
means you can look forward to the same professional level content covering every aspect of web development

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,560
from HTML to React.

12
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:11,110
This is the only course you need to become a professional, full-stack web developer. And the best part,

13
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,320
the course is completely project-based, so that means you're going to learn everything you need to

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,780
know while building beautiful real-world websites and web applications.

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,480
You'll build a beautiful product website using HTML, CSS and bootstrap.

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,050
You'll build games and musical apps like this drum kit.

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,710
You'll learn about Node, React and the MERN stack to build classic developer projects like a to-do list

18
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:44,140
app and a project manager that's perfect for showing off at your next interview.

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:49,240
If you're curious, take a look at the downloadable curriculum to learn more.

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,520
Now, this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

21
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,900
So if you're a complete beginner, I'll be there every step of the way, taking you from programming

22
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,850
fundamentals all the way through to intermediate and more advanced concepts.

23
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:12,520
Now, if you're an advanced developer, then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that

24
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,390
suits you best.

25
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:21,100
So instead of spending $12,000 on an in-person Bootcamp and having to take time off work, you're going

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,490
to get access to exactly the same curriculum that has years of design and testing behind it.

27
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,260
So you won't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it.

28
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,080
Now, don't just take my word for it.
