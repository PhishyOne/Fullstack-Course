00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,760
Hey guys, it's Angela from the App Brewery.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,480
And in this lesson, we're going to deep dive into how exactly does the Internet work?

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,010
So what exactly is the Internet?

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,530
A lot of people think it's a cloud, something that's hanging around in the sky,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,340
it's super complex, super difficult to understand, but actually, that's not it at all.

6
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,860
The Internet is pretty simple.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,520
All it is is just a long piece of wire,

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,640
and wire connects different computers to each other.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,160
So you might have one computer that's in London and another one that's in Seattle, and they can talk

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,490
to each other and transfer data through this giant wire.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,630
Now, some of these computers attached the Internet have a very special job.

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:49,110
They have to be online 24 seven, ready to serve you all the data and files that you are requesting

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,150
when you try to access a website,

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,300
and these are called servers.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,810
And what they do is they serve you all the data and files you need to be able to access and interact

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,250
with certain websites.

17
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,820
So these computers are called servers, and any computer that a user would use to access the Internet

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,210
is called a client.

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,590
Now, you can imagine a web server as a giant library that's open 24 seven, and you can go in there

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,200
at any hour of the day and say, I want to see Google's home page or I want to see the latest posts

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,600
on TechCrunch and would be able to serve you with all the files and data you would need to be able to

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,380
view whatever website you want.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,070
Now, as you can imagine, if there's a library that's big enough to house all of these websites, then

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,370
it's going to be pretty difficult to quickly locate the thing that you want out of this giant library,

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,940
right?

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,550
So how is this problem solved on the Internet?

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,490
Well, let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in Google.com because you

28
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,980
want to head over to the main Google home page.

29
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,470
Well, what happens behind the scenes is that your browser will send that message to your ISP or your

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,140
Internet service provider.

31
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,690
So these are the people who you pay to be able to access the Internet.

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,830
If you live in the US, that will be AT&T or Comcast,

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,490
and if you're in the UK, that would be something like BT or TalkTalk.

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,690
Now the message that you're sending the ISP is I want to see Google.com and the ISP will then relay

35
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,710
that message to something called a DNS server, which stands for a domain name system server.

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,180
And a DNS server is essentially just a souped up phone book.

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,060
And what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS server will look up in its

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,940
database to find the exact IP address of that website that you're trying to access.

39
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,270
And every single computer that's connected to the Internet has an IP address.

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,740
It's kind of like a postal code for your computer so that when people need to send and receive files

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,940
on the Internet, each computer can be located and contacted using their unique IP address.

42
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,930
And once the DNS server finds that IP address, it will send it back to your browser through the ISP,

43
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,160
over the internet.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,090
Then you can make a direct request to that address.

45
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,180
And what lives at that IP address is of course the Google servers, and they'll be able to send you

46
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,090
back all the files and data you need to be able to view the Google home page.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,300
Now you can try this for yourself to look up the IP address of the Google home page. Head over to this

48
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:41,520
website, nslookup.io and type in Google.com and they should show you the exact IP address of the Google

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,470
servers that you can access.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,920
So if you copy it and paste it into a new tab, then you'll be able to replicate that process and see

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,510
the Google home page show up.

52
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,670
So to summarize, the Internet is just a bunch of wires that connects up different computers, but it's

53
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,290
just on a much bigger scale connecting up all the computers in the world.

54
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,820
But what about the oceans?

55
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,950
I hear you ask.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,450
Well, that's one of the coolest things.

57
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,790
There are these massive undersea cables connecting all the continents on Earth.

58
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,570
And if you head over to submarinecablemap.com, you can see all of these cables and see the ones

59
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,700
that connect you up to the Internet.

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,360
And these undersea cables are massive, consisting of hundreds of fiber optic fibers, each of them

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,310
using lasers to transmit up to 400 gigabytes of data per second.

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,970
This is a cross-section of one of the cables that runs to New Zealand.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,880
It's an absolute marvel of modern technology, and it looks really beautiful, don't you think?

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,580
And to think that every single time we load up a web page or click on a button on a website, behind

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,910
the scenes was sending signals that navigates all of this crazy underwater and above water wires

66
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,820
and all I need is just an IP address.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,220
And through tiny electric signals, traveling at the speed of light through the oceans and halfway around

68
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,880
the world,

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,720
in a matter of milliseconds, I get to view my favorite websites, and that is how awesome the Internet

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,290
is.

71
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,880
And we're gonna be taking it to build our own websites and web apps.

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,400
And to be able to do that, we first have to understand how exactly do websites work.

73
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,000
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
