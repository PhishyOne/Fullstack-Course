00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:07,710
Now, one of the common things that I hear students say is, hey, why is it that when I go through

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,200
the tutorial, everything seems so easy and so obvious, but then when

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,180
I try to do something myself, like create a project myself or try to complete a code challenge

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,970
and it seems like almost as if I actually didn't learn anything at all.

5
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,990
Well, the reason is because that the learning comes from the practice.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,910
So don't view watching the videos as learning.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,790
That's just me introducing you to a concept.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,460
It's only when you apply it yourself, then do you actually learn.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:49,140
So always try to watch the video, see what's happening, what the gist is, maybe take down a few notes,

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,520
names of functions or things that you might need to use and then pause the video and try to complete

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,150
it yourself.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,680
That way you're actually putting the skills into practice and you're actually learning instead of just

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,000
absorbing passively.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,550
And one of the biggest learnings I've read and one of the most interesting things from psychology

15
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,590
studies is something called the Dunning Kruger effect, which is where when you first start learning

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,220
something, you can feel like, wow, I know so much.

17
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,380
I know everything there is to know about this topic.

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,560
But then as you gain more knowledge, you realize, oh, no, actually there's a lot more stuff out

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,660
there that I don't know.

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,480
And then you fall into a pit, which is called the Valley of Despair.

21
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:43,470
And this is also sometimes referred to as imposter syndrome, where even though you feel like you've

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,830
spent a lot of time learning the skill, you feel a bit like an imposter because you think people are

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,040
going to find out that I actually don't know anything.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,080
And both of these are exaggerations.

25
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,110
You are somewhere in between both of those places.

26
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:03,150
And if you just keep persevering, keep practicing, keep putting what you've learned into action,

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,850
then you're going to get there in the end.

28
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,300
So keep going.
