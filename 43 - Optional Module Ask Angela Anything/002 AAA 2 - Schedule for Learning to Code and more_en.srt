1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,210
Hey, guys, how y'all doing?

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:11,340
This is our second AMA to date, and it seems like the last one you guys were quite fond of.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:20,070
I got lots of messages on Twitter about how many push-ups you're doing, trying to beat my record, which

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,690
is not that hard to do, to be honest.

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:27,900
But I'm glad that my ranting into the camera is helping somebody out there.

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,030
As long as it's useful for one person, then I'm happy to keep doing this.

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:42,450
So it's another month and another AMA and lots of exciting things have happened between last month

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,170
and this month.

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,240
So I was invited by the Cape Town government to go and give a talk about the sharing economy and how

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,970
technology can be used to improve adoption.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,260
It was a really, really interesting event, actually full of really cool people.

12
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,510
But more importantly, Cape Town is incredible.

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,880
It's just such a beautiful city.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,390
I was really shocked.

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,520
Like literally everywhere I look was just stunning.

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,870
And I'm so jealous of you guys who live in Cape Town.

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,070
And from the stats, I can see that there's quite a few Udemy students who are from South Africa.

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,400
So big shout out to you guys because you guys live in, like, one of the most beautiful places ever.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,660
I mean, I know there's problems, but there's problems everywhere.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,830
And to be honest, it's not really that safe in London either.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,350
And even though I'm thinking about moving somewhere else,

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,420
I don't know yet where. If you have any good pointers, any good locations that you're fond of,

23
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,210
be sure to hit me up on Twitter @yu_angela.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,770
All right.

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,600
So enough about me.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,900
Let's talk more about AMA questions.

27
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:07,140
So you guys have been really active on the AMA questions and the team has sorted through a whole bunch

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,940
of new questions for me to answer.

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,900
And so the rest of my team are playing Portal two today.

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,260
They're just having a bit of afterwork fun.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,760
But this is also pretty fun for me.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,020
So let's get started.

33
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,840
So the first question comes from Victor Mameshyn.

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,880
Yeah, I'm glad that in the last AMA I didn't get called out by anybody whose name that I mispronounced

35
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,000
and mangled in a horrible way.

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,600
So if I do get your name wrong, I'm really sorry, but the good British way is just to keep going and

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,240
carry on, which is what I'm going to do.

38
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,710
So Victor has asked.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,640
Hi, Angela.

40
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,370
Thanks for your efforts a lot in keeping us moving forwards on.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,710
In your opinion, how many hours should a developer spend weekly working or learning to become a successful

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:06,930
developer and be acquainted with the latest technologies in the field, e.g. 35 hours working or 5 

43
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,980
hours learning?

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,470
OK, so this is something that I have a really, really strong opinion about.

45
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:21,780
So in my experience, you need to spend about an hour a day at the minimum to keep up with new developments,

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:30,030
new technologies, you know, web developer guys, you know how many new frameworks gets released every

47
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,260
week, every month.

48
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,780
And it's really tough keeping on top of things.

49
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,100
And based on the experience of my friends who work in large tech companies, you know, you do get time

50
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,500
for sort of R&D and learning, but it's kind of in your own time.

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:52,170
And even if you're learning stuff or if the company is paying for it, then it's usually something that

52
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,290
has to be related or directly related to what you're doing in your day to day job.

53
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:05,910
And this is something that we thought about really carefully when we set up our company, when we started

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,340
employing people, because it's really, really important to get the company culture right from the

55
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,820
beginning.

56
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:22,290
And it was my decision that everybody who works at our company is entitled to one hour and not just

57
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,570
any one hour, but your best one hour.

58
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,080
So that's first thing in the morning from nine o'clock to ten o'clock.

59
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,650
That hour is blocked out for learning.

60
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,480
And it doesn't matter what you want to learn.

61
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,950
You know, if you're an iOS developer, you can learn about developing for the blockchain.

62
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,290
If you're a machine learning guy, you can learn about Augmented Reality.

63
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,790
It really doesn't matter as long as it's something that you want to learn

64
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:54,360
and, you know, you can dedicate that one hour of prime brain time to it.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,510
And, you know, I think a lot of running a company is about finding

66
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,420
really smart people who want to work for you and keeping those smart people around. And smart people

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,890
tend to have a need to learn stuff and you know, you guys included,

68
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,180
right?

69
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,900
Why are you enrolled on this course?

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,250
You know, and it's because you're curious and you're intelligent.

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:22,760
You want to further your own knowledge, right? Further the breadth or the depth of your own, your own

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,310
skill set.

73
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,150
So this is something that's really, really fundamental and important to our company at the App Brewery.

74
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,560
And, you know, every employee, no matter how important or how senior they are, get this privilege.

75
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,640
And it's something that's really fundamental.

76
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,010
It's been there from the beginning and it's something that I'm certainly going to continue going forward.

77
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:57,500
So what I recommend for you, if you can, try to spend an hour of your best brain time, at least an hour

78
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,070
every day, to learn something new. And it doesn't even have to be programming related.

79
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,450
It can be design,

80
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,730
it can be what are the latest growth hacks.

81
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:17,000
But, you know, the main point, I guess, is to pick and choose when you learn. Because your hour

82
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:26,420
after work, after dinner at maybe 9 PM is not going to be as effective as your one hour, you

83
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,910
know, in the morning after you've just woken up.

84
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,330
And if you have the ability to dictate your own time, then I would recommend somewhere between 9

85
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,420
and 10, 9 and 11, to do your learning.

86
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,290
But if you don't have the ability to do that, if you work from 9:00 to 5:00 or whenever, then you

87
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:52,310
kind of have to have the discipline to be able to wake up earlier and allocate your time wisely so that

88
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,970
you actually dedicate your good brain, still functioning brain, to learning rather than, you know,

89
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,030
at the end of the day when it's all kind of gone to mush.

90
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,390
That's the way with me anyways.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:14,150
And so what I try to do in my day is that, you know, I have a threshold for work, say if I'm able

92
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:20,870
to operate at above 80% efficiency, I know I sound like a robot by saying this, but if I'm

93
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:28,370
able to operate my brain at more than 80% efficiency, then I will dedicate it to creative work,

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,090
such as creating new course content for you guys or, you know, learning new technologies.

95
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,130
If I'm able to achieve brain efficiency above 50%, then I'll do some more mundane tasks like

96
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:51,770
answering emails and more signing this and that, kind of more boring stuff that doesn't require so

97
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,640
much thinking.

98
00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:00,230
If I'm at brain efficiency like less than 50% where I don't feel like I'm productive at all,

99
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,540
I won't actually work.

100
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,810
And that doesn't mean I'll go on Facebook or go on Instagram or procrastinate, because that also takes

101
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:19,280
a lot of energy to kind of hunt and gather to go to these, like, endless swipe apps where you're actually

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,680
using a lot of attention just to hunt for that next exciting thing.

103
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,060
And it's kind of weird, but it takes up a lot of effort

104
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:36,080
if you actually think about it, you don't feel relaxed after you scroll through Facebook for 20 minutes.

105
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,940
You don't feel refreshed after going through Reddit for 20 minutes.

106
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,130
So if I'm at low brain efficiency, I would rather rest.

107
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:57,320
So that could be anything from going for a walk outside or going to the gym or meditating, basically

108
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,160
something that doesn't require any part of my logical brain.

109
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,990
It's more physical activity and I find that helps me to reset.

110
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:09,170
So it's a bit like shutting down and restarting

111
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,990
and I find that helps me a lot.

112
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:20,000
So what I would say is it's really important not just to think about how many hours you're learning

113
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,480
or how many hours you're working on something, but to also make it more granular and think about what

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,170
kind of time am I dedicating to my learning?

115
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,780
Am I dedicating my effective brain time or am I dedicating my crappy brain time?

116
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,710
And to answer the other part of your question regarding how long should you work on programming problems

117
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,640
in order to become a better programmer, it's also not as straightforward.

118
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:55,400
I have friends who, you know, work at large corporates as developers or SaaS ops or basically anything

119
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,480
technical, essentially, and some people have

120
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:09,820
incredibly creative and logically tasking jobs where they're being stretched and they're being challenged

121
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,250
on a daily basis, but other people, especially the more senior ones, they kind of can probably do

122
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,590
what they're doing at their work with their eyes closed.

123
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:25,630
And so, you know, when you're talking about how many hours would you work on programming in order

124
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:32,230
to get more efficient, then you have to work at problems or things that really stretch you,

125
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,600
right?

126
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:39,010
I mean, it's like you have to constantly try and chase that curve, that sweet spot that's just a little

127
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:46,390
bit above your competence and still having a little bit of challenge so that you're not bored and you're

128
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,130
constantly learning and growing.

129
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,760
All right.

130
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,270
So let's move on to the next one.

131
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,650
So this is from Simon Fitch and he says, Hi, Angela

132
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,970
I got a quick AMA for you.

133
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:04,190
Can you recommend a website where we can practice beginner to intermediate Swift coding examples challenges?

134
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,210
OK, cool.

135
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:12,130
So for Simon and anybody else who has this question, so I've seen this question come up a few times

136
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,830
in the Q&A as well.

137
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,590
And it's a really, really good question because it's true.

138
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:22,360
You know, whenever you learn about programming, the instructors tend to always recommend, you know,

139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,770
learn a little bit every day

140
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:29,740
and, you know, the effects will compound and you'll eventually become, you know, a programming ninja,

141
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,050
right?

142
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,340
But what exactly do you do every day?

143
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:39,070
How do you find these programming challenges that you can practice?

144
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:43,710
So I've got a few of my favorite resources.

145
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,590
So one is a Project Euler.

146
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,890
So this is a website where you can browse a whole bunch of different questions and you can sort them

147
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,860
by how many people have solved it.

148
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,590
So it's kind of like how difficult it is, right?

149
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,110
So the more people who've solved it, then it's probably a good one to get started with.

150
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,600
And then if you look at the ones that are the most difficult, where only a handful or 100 people have

151
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,870
actually solved it, then that's really going to be a real challenge for you.

152
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:20,110
And the beauty of these problems is that they're more algorithm orientated.

153
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,170
So, you know, you could pretty much answer these or solve them using any programming language you

154
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:32,520
like as long as, you know, basically the fundamentals are all the same,

155
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:32,830
right?

156
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,510
So that's one thing.

157
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,850
Check out Project Euler.

158
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,460
The other one that I really recommend is something called CodeFights.

159
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,020
And what you can do is you can sign up for an account and select your language.

160
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:53,530
Now I know it says Swift 3, but the changes between Swift 3 and Swift 4 are so minimal

161
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,140
that this is really not going to affect you.

162
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,300
So just choose a swift 3 until they update to

163
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,720
Swift 4

164
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,110
I guess.

165
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:09,580
And then you can browse through the arcade where you've got some relatively simple problems.

166
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,380
And the beauty of this website is that they have a whole bunch of tests.

167
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:21,670
So it's kind of like test-driven development, but it's more about the algorithms that you can create.

168
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,990
So what I recommend is that if you're more or less a beginner/intermediate to start with their

169
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:36,490
arcade and work upwards. And then once you get a little bit better and more familiar with algorithms

170
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:44,710
to go for their challenges, and you can sort the challenges by difficulty and you can also view the

171
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,600
solutions after you've attempted it as well.

172
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,140
So this is a really nice way of practicing daily, weekly, monthly and getting better at, you know,

173
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,930
not just algorithms, but also things like UI and front-end.

174
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:06,400
Now, the final thing and probably the most important thing is, of course, to make apps.

175
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,340
You guys are on an app making course.

176
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,170
It's really important that you take these skills that you learn and you actually apply it to a problem

177
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:24,250
where I'm not specifically laying out, you know, the pathway, because this is essentially what you

178
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,740
have to do, whether if you become an independent developer, if you want to start a business or if

179
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,320
you're going to work at a startup or work in a tech company, you have to be able to figure things out

180
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,300
by yourself. And throughout the course I've been laying down some of these fundamentals, like how do

181
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,010
you get to the iOS docs?

182
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,360
How do you read them?

183
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,470
How do you interpret them?

184
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,270
How can you find example code?

185
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,400
How can you find open source libraries and how do you go through Stack Overflow?

186
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,870
And, you know, you don't have to make anything difficult.

187
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,380
Just try and build something that we haven't built before,

188
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:06,520
right? Maybe build a time up like an egg timer or maybe build something that you need specifically.

189
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:15,510
So recently I've been reading a book by Ray Dalio who is at the helm of one of the biggest and

190
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,490
most successful hedge funds.

191
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,080
And he was saying about how at Bridgewater they have this app, internal app called The Pain Button.

192
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,980
And what you do is that whenever you experience pain, be it emotional, intellectual or, you know,

193
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:40,260
or frustration, just to take out the app and log what that pain point was about so that you can come

194
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:47,940
back to it and develop processes or solutions or give feedback, basically catching those pain points

195
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,830
in the moment so that you can deal with them later.

196
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,880
And I thought this is a really, really good idea.

197
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,040
And I was browsing on the App Store and nobody seemed to have made this externally.

198
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,070
I know it's available to Bridgewater employees, but, you know, it seems pretty useful for everybody

199
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,610
else as well.

200
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,190
So if anybody is looking for an easy app to make, then this is pretty feasible.

201
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,050
I would recommend it.

202
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,210
And once you do make it, let me know because I will be downloading it.

203
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,590
So look for pains or ways of scratching your own itch.

204
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,240
Any small problem that you have, you can turn it into an app for practice. There's a really great website

205
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,860
that I'll link to in this AMA that's called, I think 365 projects.

206
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:40,260
And it was created by this lady who decided to make a new website every single day as practice to get

207
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,060
better at Web development.

208
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,980
And I think this is a really good idea for app developers as well.

209
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,570
You know, make a new app that takes maybe less than two hours.

210
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:59,220
Definitely feasible, by the way. Any sort of simple app that you can think of and make a new one every

211
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,790
single day,

212
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,120
right?

213
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,210
So you can look at her website for examples.

214
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:11,359
But some good ones are things like story cubes or a notepad or like a meditation music player.

215
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,750
And these are all really, really feasible and definitely within your abilities as a beginner to intermediate

216
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,160
iOS developer.

217
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:20,910
All right.

218
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,780
So next question from Alberto Martinez.

219
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,810
So thanks for the video.

220
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,610
Angela is very nice to see you on screen.

221
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,020
Hello.

222
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,850
Here I am again.

223
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,820
AMA question, how many languages do you speak?

224
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,890
I mean, both kinds of programming languages and real languages.

225
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,310
OK, cool.

226
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,250
So start with real languages is more tangible.

227
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:51,570
So I speak English obviously, and I speak Mandarin Chinese fluently.

228
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,610
I can read and write in both languages pretty effectively.

229
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,780
So the crazy thing that people tend to ask me on Twitter is where my accent is from.

230
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:13,170
And I know that it has distinct elements of an Australian accent, but I have actually sadly never been

231
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,070
to Australia.

232
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:26,400
So what I reckon is the deal is that sometimes when I watch something or when I talk to somebody extensively,

233
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,090
then I tend to pick up on their accent and that's just something that happens to me.

234
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,930
I don't know why.

235
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:42,720
And I think part of the problem or the solution is that when I first moved to the UK, when I was about

236
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:51,300
10 years old, I moved with my parents here and they didn't really think about teaching me any English

237
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,380
before then.

238
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,820
So I was kind of just dropped into this unfamiliar world.

239
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,850
And, you know, I think you guys who've been on the course for long enough know that I'm incredibly

240
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,680
sociable and I love talking to people and I love interacting with humans.

241
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,340
But here I am in this brand new country and I don't speak a single word, not even hello.

242
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,200
I didn't even know how to say that much.

243
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,930
So it was pretty painful.

244
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,990
But it was actually pretty fast, I would say

245
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,450
I picked up the language in less than six months because you're young and because you know...

246
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,060
and because you don't really have anything else to do,

247
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,450
right?

248
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,400
You just try to talk to people with sign language or when they point to a table and they said table,

249
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,270
you assume that's what they mean.

250
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:45,000
So I think that's probably one of the reasons why my accent is so fluid, because I was never really

251
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,540
taught English properly, mostly by feel like how a child would pick it up, although they say that

252
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,430
I was quite old at age 10 or 11 to pick up a new language.

253
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,680
But here we are.

254
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,230
So.

255
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,980
And now I'm kind of sad that my parents didn't, you know, move, why don't you move to Spain?

256
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,130
Why don't you move to, you know, Paris and then go to Germany, move to a different place every year?

257
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:14,470
I could speak five languages, but, hey, you know, they decide to go to a really dreary country and

258
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,040
here I am.

259
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,900
So, again, if you have any suggestions for better places for Angela to move to, please hit me up

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,500
on Twitter.

261
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,170
I'm looking to crowdsource this solution.

262
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,210
And, you know, I do a lot of flying around already to talk at conferences so it doesn't really matter

263
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,270
where I live anyways.

264
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:38,040
OK, so other than English and Chinese, I could also speak French and German.

265
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,380
I've been learning it for four or five years, but they're still not really all that great or as good

266
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,970
as like I'd like them to be.

267
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,350
So,

268
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:54,700
so unfortunately, I'm nowhere near being able to do AMAs in French or German anytime soon, but I'm

269
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,480
working on it.

270
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,130
So rest assured it's going to happen one day.

271
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,830
So what about programming languages?

272
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,630
So the first language that I learned was visual basic using the very friendly-looking visual studio,

273
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,550
and I think that was pretty easy to pick up on.

274
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:21,250
I think I had a really logical mind as a child and also a strangely I think I was strangely disciplined

275
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,090
as a child.

276
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,100
I mean, like the 11-year-old Angela was not outside playing around. She was like trying to build

277
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,500
a video game for like five hours a day.

278
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,370
So that's what I did during my summer holidays.

279
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,980
And, you know, here we are.

280
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,430
So I can't complain.

281
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:46,150
So after visual basic, I moved on to C because somebody told me that was a good foundation and that

282
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,400
person is probably just evil.

283
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:57,490
I don't know how many of you guys have learnt C, but for a 12-year-old, it is really hard, you know,

284
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,570
with pointers and everything.

285
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm glad that I did it because it's like trial by fire.

286
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:08,080
And it gives you a really good basis for understanding every other language because it's quite low level,

287
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,550
it's quite close to the metal.

288
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:19,900
So after C was C++, because I wanted to be able to build real video games, not just like Brick

289
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,470
Breaker.

290
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:29,380
And then after that was Objective C, so when I wanted to build iOS apps and of course then it was Swift

291
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:35,350
and then we launched this company and then some clients wanted to be able to have a website with their

292
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,800
apps.

293
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,760
So I had to pick up JavaScript including a whole bunch of frameworks.

294
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,990
And I think, you know, in my experience, learning one real language, like knowing English and then

295
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,760
being able to speak German, it's a far bigger jump than, say, knowing an object-oriented language

296
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,940
like a Swift and then being able to jump to Java.

297
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,030
It's way, way easier because all the concepts are exactly the same.

298
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,200
And when you're programming, you're not talking right?

299
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,920
You don't have to...

300
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,620
you don't have to be able to, you don't have to convey your code in real-time to somebody that that's

301
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,610
just crazy.

302
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,800
So you can look up things like, you know what are delegates and protocols in Java? Oh, they're

303
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,870
similar to these things called interfaces.

304
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,400
And this is how you write it.

305
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,420
This is the syntax.

306
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,610
And oh, that looks really awesome.

307
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:35,950
And because you already know how it works and the abstract concept behind it, then you're pretty much

308
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,610
good to go.

309
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:44,050
And it's just changing a bracket here, substituting a semicolon for a space or, you know, it's really,

310
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,030
really way easier learning new programming languages.

311
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,190
And I hope that if Swift is your first programming language and it's really, really well suited to

312
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,350
be a first programming language. If it is indeed the first thing that you've learned in programming,

313
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:08,020
I do hope that you will go on to pick up other languages and be able to develop apps or websites or

314
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,300
programs in a whole bunch of different languages.

315
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:16,300
And you'll find that once you've mastered one language, it's really not that hard jumping to anything

316
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:16,660
else.

317
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,630
I mean, obviously, conceptually, programming languages can be placed into different camps.

318
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:29,500
So you've got a procedural, object-orientated and you know, some of these newer languages which are pretty

319
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,360
fancy but a little bit different.

320
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:40,150
At the end of the day, all you're trying to do is use the machine's processing power efficiently,

321
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:47,860
being able to communicate with the ones and zeros and get it to add, subtract, divide and do essentially

322
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,640
the same things.

323
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:54,070
So I remember there was this really good post on imager where it says if programming languages were

324
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,320
weapons, I'm definitely anti-gun.

325
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,930
But this is actually a really good post that sumarises

326
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,480
what each programming language would be if they were a gun.

327
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,890
So, for example, C would be a Garand issue rifle, old but reliable.

328
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:14,270
C++ is a set of nunchucks, powerful and impressive when wielded, but takes many years of pain to master.

329
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,400
And often you probably wish you were using something else.

330
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,740
So I don't know if you guys have ever played around with nunchucks, but my god, how many times you have

331
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,230
to hurt yourself before you actually understand how to use this thing.

332
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:32,120
C++ is always very similar. Perl is a Molotov cocktail is probably useful once, but a few people use it now.

333
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:40,640
Java is a belt-fed 240G automatic weapon where sometimes the belt has round, sometimes it doesn't.

334
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,940
And when it doesn't, during firing you get a null pointer exception.

335
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,790
The gun explodes and you die.

336
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,490
We don't...

337
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,030
So we don't have that problem as badly in Swift because of course we have optional rules.

338
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,150
So if you're good with optionals, then you shouldn't be getting this problem.

339
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,510
Scala is a variant of the two for e.g. Java, except the training manual is written in incomprehensible

340
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,060
dialect, which many suspect is just gibberish.

341
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,100
Totally true.

342
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,760
I tried to get into it once,

343
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,120
not quite sure what happened there.

344
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,710
JavaScript is a sword without hilt.

345
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,730
Oh my god,

346
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:20,900
if you go to JavaScript from Swift, I can assure you that you will feel scared like 50% of the

347
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,320
time.

348
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,790
You're like, wait, I can, I can do what? That's allowed?

349
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,700
Wait a second.

350
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,730
I can go outside of my array and it doesn't break and it doesn't let me know? What?

351
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,600
What the hell?

352
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,980
So yeah.

353
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:44,870
JavaScript. Scary, I think, is the is the word.

354
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,670
Bash is a cursed hammer, when welded everything looks like a nail, especially your thumb.

355
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,650
So if you guys have worked with the terminal and bash it's totally true.

356
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,320
Ruby is a ruby encrusted sword.

357
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,140
It's usually only used because of how shiny it is.

358
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,360
That's the impression I get as well.

359
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,400
C# is a powerful laser rifle strapped to a donkey, when taken off the donkey,

360
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,800
the laser doesn't seem to work as well.

361
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,050
And Lisp is a shiv, which comes in many forms.

362
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,410
Anyone who uses this is probably crazy and dangerous and I concur.

363
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:25,150
Everyone who I've met who uses Lisp as their main language, pretty crazy. And another really good one

364
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:30,780
that I came across at some point was GIT the princess! how to save the princess using 8 programming languages.

365
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,920
So, for example, you have JavaScript, you spent hours picking libraries, setting up node and building

366
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,120
up a framework for the castle.

367
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,710
By the time you're finished with the framework, the fort has been abandoned and the princess has moved

368
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,640
to another castle.

369
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:50,140
And the best part is when you get to the end. You have PHP. You have to rescue the princess in PHP and you

370
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,640
basically just give up and hang yourself.

371
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:59,140
So it's pretty funny. I'll link to all of these things if you guys want to have a bit of programming

372
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,370
humor to lighten your day.

373
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:07,990
So that was a pretty long answer to a really short question, but I hope I've clarified a few things.

374
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:16,090
So next question, Sinead. So completely random, but as a former doctor I would love to know how you manage,

375
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,000
how you eat when you're working long periods of time.

376
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,030
OK, so here's an interesting story.

377
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,750
I was really drawn to the idea of Soylent.

378
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:33,130
So for those of you guys who don't know, it's meant to be a nutritionally complete milk protein powder

379
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,420
shake, basically.

380
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,060
And it was a really, really cool idea.

381
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:44,800
You know, like what if I could just sit there and code for 12 hours straight without having to, you

382
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,610
know, spend half an hour on making or securing food?

383
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,220
What if I could just, like, shake something up and do this for a week and build some grand project

384
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,120
and I'll make, like, you know, the Angela blockchain by the end of it or something.

385
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:06,010
But the problem with it, if anybody tried it, is that it tastes horrible.

386
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,610
It tastes like this is the best way I can describe it.

387
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:17,440
It tastes like somebody took a cardboard box, soaked it in some old bath water and then got a Vita

388
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,390
mix and then blended it into a smoothie.

389
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,800
It tastes like it basically tastes like that.

390
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,440
I've heard that they've improved their formulas, but I just... I couldn't... I had to check all of the ones

391
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,250
I bought before

392
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,570
and it was it was just it was just awful, like it was completely unpalatable.

393
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,380
So I have no association with them.

394
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,310
I'm not advertising or not advertising, although I don't think that would be a very good advert.

395
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,240
But I thought it was awful.

396
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,020
So what else can you do?

397
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,140
What else can you eat to when you're working long periods of time?

398
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:02,590
So I am the proponent of high protein and low carbohydrate intake just because I find that carbs give

399
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:10,330
me carb coma and I can't concentrate as well and I can't work efficiently for long periods of time.

400
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,930
So very often in the morning, I tend to just start off my day with a can of sardines and throughout the

401
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,520
day I might have some protein shakes.

402
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I'll probably end up having a proper lunch and a proper dinner.

403
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:28,210
But if I'm doing like a programming stint, like where some project has to be finished or has been done,

404
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:34,540
then I tend to do it during the night and I find that when it's dark, I need to eat less.

405
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,120
I don't know if that's true for everybody.

406
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:42,940
And I tend to just stick to protein shakes, which is probably not going to be terrible for a week,

407
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,000
but it's probably a bad idea if you do it any longer than that.

408
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,670
But again, I am not going to dish out any medical advice over the Internet.

409
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,450
Don't trust me on anything.

410
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,320
Always check your sources and ask your doctor.

411
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:03,100
But I think one of my biggest takeaways from this current year 2017, one of my most successful

412
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:08,590
body hack experiments has actually been quitting sugar.

413
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:14,500
So I came across this article I remember what it was called, and it seemed to present some really interesting

414
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,820
facts and findings.

415
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:22,840
And so I then went on to PubMed, did some research on my own and seemed and it seemed like this idea

416
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,360
of being off, not just refined sugar, but most sources of sugar is probably quite good for you in

417
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,250
terms of inflammation and everything else.

418
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:38,200
So for the last, I don't know, like four or five months now, I've been off sugar.

419
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:45,610
So I know it sounds really crazy, but sugar is a drug.

420
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,320
And I realized this when I first tried to get off it.

421
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,320
So previously I think I would probably have a granola in the morning, which I thought was really healthy,

422
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,440
and then I would probably have some chocolate around 11 o'clock, some more chocolate around 3:00,

423
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,270
and then I probably have dinner with some dessert, like a chocolate pudding.

424
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,190
You know, some of those things are my favorites.

425
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:19,260
And then one day I decided to just go cold turkey, basically just nothing, no refined sugar, no glucose,

426
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:23,550
dextrose, fructose, lactose, everything was off the table.

427
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,960
Anything that ended in an ozair sugar was off the menu.

428
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:36,300
And quite honestly, for the first two days, I had physical symptoms, like I felt fluey and I felt

429
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,260
like really crap.

430
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:43,080
And, you know, I was just like really nervous for no reason.

431
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:51,300
I mean, of course, there is a reason because, you know, I've been used to dosing myself

432
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,450
with sugar on like a six hourly basis.

433
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,700
And now I'm not eating sweet fruits,

434
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,370
I'm not eating anything with refined sugar

435
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,070
and it was a pretty big jump, I have to say.

436
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,900
But so I would say for the first week, the first two days were the worst.

437
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:14,640
They were they actually made me want to just to go back to normal and then three, four or five were

438
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,730
kind of meh.

439
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,950
But then on the seventh day was when

440
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:30,650
I woke up and I felt like as if these clouds in my head had just cleared and I felt mentally sharp and

441
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:38,600
I felt really, really productive and just like a level of mental clarity that I didn't have while I

442
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,440
was on sugar, I think, or had very infrequently. Previously what I used to think was just, you

443
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,740
know, tired or or stressed or irritated

444
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,270
it was actually all sugar cravings that were doing it.

445
00:33:53,270 --> 00:34:00,560
And I now recognize it because, you know, if I have any sugar, you know, a significant amount of

446
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:00,740
it

447
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:09,560
and then after about five or six hours, predictably, I would feel nervous because I'm ready for my

448
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,460
next dose.

449
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,020
And it is that crazy.

450
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,610
It's like it's cocaine or heroin.

451
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,860
It's probably more addictive than both.

452
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:23,449
But that has been my experiment sort of body hack-wise last year, this year.

453
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:33,530
And it has been pretty dramatic, I can say, like I feel I feel more mentally alert.

454
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,449
I feel like I have more energy.

455
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:46,159
And I just generally feel like I'm performing at a higher level than I used to when I was

456
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,830
like full time on sugar.

457
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,980
So obviously, this is not, you know, medical advice or anything, but, you know, do your own research.

458
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,740
But I would say that it's it's an experiment that's well worth conducting, even if you don't, you

459
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,380
know, don't cut out fruits or don't cut out milk,

460
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:10,280
but if you just cut out refined sugar for like two weeks, you know, and you can stick to it, it's

461
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,450
it's pretty interesting.

462
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,850
The results, I would say it's worth a try.

463
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,090
OK, so we seem to be stuck on the food theme here.

464
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,420
But this is from Jonas Elholm.

465
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,330
Hey, Angela, I'm in.

466
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,500
My only question is how many cups of coffee in a row can a person handle a day? Five or ten

467
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,430
cups from a doctor's point of view, thanks for great setup

468
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:40,550
and UI. OK, cool, so I can't give medical advice over the Internet, speak to your own doctor.

469
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:50,300
But when I've had to make targets that are pretty much unrealistic and I'm doing these crazy coding

470
00:35:50,300 --> 00:36:01,010
stunts and I need coffee, not really to stay awake, but more like liquid motivation because it was

471
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,190
just too daunting a task without it.

472
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,340
I've relied on an app that is called Caffeine Zone.

473
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,210
It looks really, really unappealing in terms of UI.

474
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:22,250
They obviously have not done the design modules in my course, but it was created by some professors

475
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,780
at Penn State University and it has a solid scientific backing to it.

476
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:33,920
So the way that it works is that you input how much caffeine you're consuming and they kind of estimate it

477
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,890
based on your drink and your drink size.

478
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:45,200
And then you input some personal details like how much do you weigh, etc. and they chart the halflife

479
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,850
decay of caffeine in your system so that once it falls below a certain threshold, they can actually

480
00:36:52,850 --> 00:37:00,530
notify you and tell you to drink more coffee so that you will stay within that productive zone of caffeination,

481
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,330
whatever it may be for you.

482
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,230
And I've played around with this app quite a while.

483
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:17,270
I started using it back, way back, in med school, actually, and it has been quite an interesting experiment

484
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:23,360
and journey to keep yourself within a certain band of caffeine for a day at a time.

485
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,800
Obviously, you had to sleep at some point and your caffeine is going to get out of your blood.

486
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,670
But this was a cool experiment.

487
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,600
I think they have a free version with ads so you can check it out.

488
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:43,220
And if anybody wants to make this take on this project and build a better version with better UX and

489
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,420
better UI, then I will be your first downloader.

490
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,830
It is really useful for me, but I just can't get over how ugly it looks.

491
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:59,510
So if anybody's looking for project, here's one to not copy but be inspired by.

492
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,730
All right, cool.

493
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:09,230
So it is now getting dark in London and my team all look like they're ready to go to the pub.

494
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,730
So I think this is probably what we're going to call it a day for this month.

495
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,720
So next month, I have a secret surprise for all of you guys

496
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:28,240
who are on the course and it's going to be pretty awesome, and I know that it's going to make quite

497
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,690
a few of you quite happy.

498
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:35,800
So keep your eyes out for an email some point mid-December.

499
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,150
I won't give any more away than that.

500
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:44,170
But it has been good chatting with you guys.

501
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:54,850
As always, send your AMA questions in so you can comment below the announcement that I made for

502
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,550
this video,

503
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:01,860
or you can simply just add your question to the Q&A for this AMA lesson.

504
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,790
So that's all from me,

505
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,260
and I will hopefully see you next month.

506
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,720
Bye, guys.
