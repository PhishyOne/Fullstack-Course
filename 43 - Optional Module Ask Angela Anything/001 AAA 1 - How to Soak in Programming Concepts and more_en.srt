00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:08,430
Hi, guys, welcome to our very first AMA for the Udemy iOS 11 course.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,770
So we've been doing a few of these on other platforms and we thought it might be fun to get you guys

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,390
to ask some questions and do it here as well.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,070
I hope you'll enjoy this.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,280
I certainly had fun making this.

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:27,130
And in the future we're going to be putting out new announcements announcing for more

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,800
AMAs so keep your eyes peeled for those announcements.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,250
And if you have any questions for any future episodes, then please put them there.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,780
So let's tackle some of these questions.

10
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,880
We've had loads and loads of questions come in and I can only answer so many.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,510
And my team has picked out some choice questions.

12
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,270
So for AMAs, we've chosen some questions that might apply to everybody.

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,580
So usually they're not specifically technical,

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,180
they're not about one specific bug or, you know, some issue.

15
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,910
We're going to try and keep that within the Q&A section so that they're of maximum benefit for the students

16
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,810
who come across it.

17
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:15,520
But for these AMAs or ask me anything, I'm really looking for questions that might appeal to everybody

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,730
or questions that are more generic.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,240
So I'm ready,

20
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:27,160
hope you are ready too. Let's get started for our very first round of Udemy AMAs.

21
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,240
So the first question comes from Handel Callender.

22
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,540
I'm going to be murdering some names today.

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,050
Just I'd like to put that out there to begin with. So I can speak a number of languages

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,750
but names are difficult sometimes, so I apologize in advance.

25
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,700
So hi, Angela, how are you doing?

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,350
I've got two questions.

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,290
Are you looking forward to the new Star Trek television show?

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,830
And in other words, are you a sci fi fan?

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,320
And the second question is, what strategies do you have for really soaking in programming concepts?

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,920
OK, so let's tackle them one at a time.

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,860
So am I looking forward to the Star Trek show?

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,280
I have to say, I've never really gotten into Star Trek.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:19,720
I think the reason is because every time I saw it on TV, it always seemed to me like it was a bunch

34
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,880
of people having a lot of meetings.

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,330
There were like a lot of meetings every single episode, and I just wasn't able to really get into it.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,620
I'm a huge sci fi fan, but I've never really managed to get into Star Trek.

37
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,310
But I'm a huge fan of sci fi as a genre.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,990
And, you know, in the last few years we've seen some really, really great stuff come out.

39
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:53,350
So my favorite movies are so things like EX Machina, the recent Blade Runner 2049 was also slow but

40
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,770
good.

41
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:01,330
It was a slow burner, but I really enjoyed it and Oh my God, Arrival, which is amazing.

42
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,140
Incredible.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,280
So, yeah, definitely a sci fi fan. Don't know very much about Star Trek.

44
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,330
OK, so the second question is about programming concepts and how do you really soak it in,

45
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,070
I guess. So

46
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,320
I think this is a really, really good question

47
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,750
and this is something that we talk about quite a lot in our in-person boot camps.

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:31,330
And I remember once coming across a rated AMA with Elon Musk not so long ago, where he answered this

49
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,490
question about how he learns things.

50
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,650
And I thought it was really, really good.

51
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:44,050
So what he said was basically, you know, to look at knowledge as if it were this huge semantic tree,

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,860
I think he called it.

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,500
And the idea is that you first tackle the trunk and the fundamentals,

54
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,100
tight?

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,620
And then once you've understood all of that, then you move on to the large branches, then the smaller

56
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,220
branches.

57
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:04,180
And only then do you go on to learn about the things such as the leaves, the flowers, the decorative elements,

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,210
because it's very easy when you're learning anything to learn about the things that will impress people.

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,340
And I've suddenly been guilty of that myself, too.

60
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,529
The problem is that when you learn these kind of superficial things that don't have any attachment to

61
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,750
a fundamental understanding, the leaves don't really have anything to hang on to.

62
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,290
And I think that was a really, really good point that he made.

63
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,930
And I think it's a really good guiding principle for learning anything, not just programming.

64
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,310
So that's one point.

65
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:42,580
The other thing I would say is that with programming specifically, you really got to start thinking

66
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,270
about making your own projects because, you know, you can do a lot of tutorials and you can do a lot

67
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,090
of challenges or even algorithmic problems.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,710
You can tackle all of that.

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,550
But until you start making things that you want to make, your own projects that you thought,

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,640
of, then you know, that's really the point when you make the big leaps, when you start really

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,210
making your knowledge your own.

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:18,530
So one of the things I always urge our students in our in-person bootcamps is to go away, is to learn

73
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,890
these skills, but go away and think of some apps and something really simple that they want to make.

74
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,130
You know, it could be a time, it could be a calculator or, you know, you might have some sort of spin

75
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,520
on tha,

76
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:31,790
right?

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:40,340
Like one of our students made an alarm clock that wakes you up one minute earlier every day so that

78
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,890
eventually, after a month, he would be able to reach his target wake up time of six o'clock.

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,330
So it's things like these that are not so difficult to make,

80
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,110
they're not something like, you know, Facebook with Twitter bolted on and a little pinch of Snapchat.

81
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,860
They're not those things.

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:04,790
And it's really important that when you first start building your own projects, don't go nuts. Don't

83
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:12,020
start making something that's completely crazy or something that's really, really complex, because

84
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,190
inevitably you will come across, you know, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns and you're

85
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,900
probably going to give up on it.

86
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,350
And, you know, certainly when I think back to when I first started doing iOS development, there have

87
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,410
been so many projects that were really good and they were probably built quite well.

88
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,910
But I was too ambitious to start with.

89
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,550
And they always failed and they became too complex, too unmanageable, too unwieldy.

90
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,400
And you inevitably end up giving up on them.

91
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,620
So don't do that, really make a minimum viable product.

92
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,890
It doesn't have to be really flashy,

93
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,940
you know. It doesn't have to be a Ferrari.

94
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,060
It could just be a kickboard.

95
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:06,590
It could just be a skateboard, even. Just keep it really, really simple and make that one thing that

96
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:13,220
works by itself and then add on or bolt on features to it.

97
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:19,310
But if you have something that's incomplete and you're still working on features, it's really, really

98
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,110
disheartening when you end up getting stuck and when you have bugs and it's just... it's not fun.

99
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,740
So my advice would be to make your own project make something really simple and just make it work.

100
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,770
And then from thereon, at the point where you can submit it to the App Store and then carry on working

101
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,590
on new features and bolt on things to it.

102
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:46,010
So that's a really, really good way of not just learning how to program, but really understanding

103
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,520
everything

104
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,850
and, you know, along the way, you're going to have to find out stuff.

105
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,070
You're not going to know how to do everything.

106
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,100
And no course on, you know, on the planet is going to be able to teach you every single thing,

107
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,420
right?

108
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,460
And I think certainly, you know, I've made a point of definitely not including every single API.

109
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,860
But the important thing is that once you understand where to look, i.e. Stack Overflow or Google or

110
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,430
Apple documentation, then you start embarking on a new journey of not just being a learner developer,

111
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,050
but being somebody who is able to figure out your own problems.

112
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,280
And the next step really is just getting very, very good at Googling.

113
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,340
Most great developers have a really essential skill that is good at Googling; knowing what

114
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,440
keywords to put in that will get you the relevant results and trawling through that and looking for

115
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,299
your solution.

116
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,520
That is a really, really key skill to acquire.

117
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,950
So don't ever let anyone make you feel that, you know, looking something up is shameful.

118
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,810
It's really not.

119
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,160
I've worked in teams and certainly friends of mine work in teams as well, where if Stack Overflow is

120
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,260
down, they just go to the pub, have a drink.

121
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,370
It's not worth it.

122
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,200
That's just you know, that's just an illustration of, I guess, the fact that programmers are lazy,

123
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,480
but also that, you know, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

124
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,730
You just have to find out how to use it and how to put that wheel on and how to fix it.

125
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,530
So next question.

126
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,550
So this is from Glen-udemy and he

127
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,540
or she.

128
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,100
I guess there's not many Glenns who are women. Anyways,

129
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,190
how do you suggest we go about getting a paying job doing this i.e. iOS development?

130
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:48,420
Well, I feel pretty comfortable with Swift iOS. I know my skills are not yet pro level, so any entry

131
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,820
level position would be fantastic suggestions.

132
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,170
Very much appreciated.

133
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,740
Thank you.

134
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,880
All right.

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,380
This is a really good question.

136
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,330
How do you get a job as a developer if you don't have any experience working as developer,

137
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:02,660
right?

138
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,890
So here's something slightly off topic.

139
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:11,490
But one of the things I realized is that recently I got really into resistance training and my goals

140
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,430
is to be able to do 10 chin-ups.

141
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,400
And, you know, I don't know if you've seen, you know, these arms.

142
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,390
They're not really the largest of guns out there.

143
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,980
But, you know, I'm determined.

144
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,170
So I'm going to get there.

145
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:31,740
But one of the things I realize is that to be able to do more pullups, I tried, you know, doing more

146
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,080
arm related exercises, trying to use various machines around the gym.

147
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:44,340
But at the end of the day, to be able to get better at doing chin-ups, I realized that ultimately

148
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,800
I just have to do more chin-ups.

149
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,320
And if you want to be able to do more pushups, you just have to do more push-ups and eventually you'll

150
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,740
get there.

151
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,010
And it's exactly the same with development.

152
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,830
To get better at development, to become a pro developer, you have to do more development and you have

153
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,730
to do it in the context of, you know, maybe a job or collaborating with other people in a team and

154
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,950
all of these skills that you need to acquire by simply doing more of it.

155
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,050
So here's the dilemma.

156
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,620
How do you get a job as an iOS developer if you don't have a portfolio and you don't have a track record

157
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,160
that you can fall back on?

158
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,670
Well, you've got to build it up, right.

159
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:33,960
So one of the first steps that I would recommend you, Glenn, or anybody else who's interested in this

160
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:43,170
topic is to simply go on to websites, freelance websites such as Upwork, oDesk or even something

161
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,480
like Fiverr and just offer your services as an iOS developer.

162
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,850
You're not going to make a lot of money from this.

163
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,050
You know, I can say that for sure.

164
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,670
You're offering your services to build up your portfolio.

165
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,620
And the key thing, though, is that you're working with real projects, you're working with real clients,

166
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,860
and you have to work with real specs.

167
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,740
So even though you're not getting paid a lot, but you're actually learning on the job, which is really,

168
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,670
really important.

169
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,350
So this is not a get rich quick formula.

170
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,080
This is very much a get rich really, really slowly formula.

171
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,070
But once you do have those skills, once you've built those portfolio sites and you've got a good working

172
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,820
relationship with your client that you can rely on for reviews and testimonials, then you're in a way

173
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,700
stronger position and you can leverage that to start charging more and more per hour until you get to

174
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,930
the point where you are proficient in iOS development or whatever it is that you can reach your, you know,

175
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,750
personal target amount that you want to earn.

176
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:57,900
So the first step is working really, really hard for not a lot of money, but for a lot of skills and

177
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,830
a lot of learning.

178
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:06,960
And throughout this journey, you're going to come across clients who are really annoying and but also

179
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,860
clients who are really awesome and people who have really, really interesting projects that you'll

180
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,560
get to build and you can call your own.

181
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,690
And along the way, you're going to come across hurdles that you're going to overcome and you'll learn

182
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:27,330
so much more and so much faster by doing this rather than just simply looking for a junior development

183
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,690
role at a company.

184
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,530
So this is my recommendation.

185
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:34,560
Obviously, you know, it's your life and totally up to you.

186
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,830
But this is what I think is the best way of going about this.

187
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:40,710
All right.

188
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:49,410
Let's go on to the next question from Roland Gavrilescu, that was probably not it.

189
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,600
OK, so hi.

190
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,060
And when and how did you start learning

191
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,250
iOS development?

192
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,300
I will also be a UCL student from next week and want to ask you, how did you spend your time at

193
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,390
UCL and what would you have done differently?

194
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,490
OK, cool.

195
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,830
So hi, Roland.

196
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,510
And you have made a very wise choice in going to UCL.

197
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,920
It's a great university.

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,990
I'm sure you're going to have a fantastic time.

199
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,430
Everybody is really, really cool, really chill and really awesome there.

200
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,790
Unlike some of the other London universities. Obviously there's a healthy bit of rivalry, but it's

201
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,220
I genuinely had a really, really good time there. Although I think my experience will probably be

202
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,580
slightly

203
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:36,860
different from yours, unless you're also doing the same degree. So I completed a medical degree there

204
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:43,580
while I was at UCL. So medical degrees are pretty much like 9-5 jobs where you have to pay

205
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,120
to work.

206
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,720
So it's slightly different from other people's student experiences where you just, I don't know, just

207
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,250
got drunk and partied all the time.

208
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,370
But, yeah, it was it was really good.

209
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,940
So your first question was how did I get into iOS development and when and how?

210
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,770
I think so.

211
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:09,590
I first got into iOS development in 2011 while I was at med school.

212
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:17,510
And the reason was because I really, really, really wanted to build this medical app that basically

213
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:26,240
gave you a whole set of symptoms and signs and you could test your diagnosis skills by using the app.

214
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,910
And that was the main motivation of why I wanted to learn iOS development.

215
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:41,000
But I mean, having started learning to code when I was around 12 or 13, having that background in

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,930
programming certainly helped me pick up those skills.

217
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:53,390
So I think one of my first games was a really, really terrible implementation of... I'm almost afraid

218
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:01,370
to look up my old code just because I know that I'm going to really be very embarrassed.

219
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,560
But hey, you know as well, what can you say?

220
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:10,040
So back then I was using visual basic and then I moved on to C++ because I wanted to make video games.

221
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:18,260
And using that background really helped me learn iOS development very quickly.

222
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,000
And certainly for you guys, you know, even though you're learning Swift, it doesn't really matter

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,210
because if you go away and you decide that, you know, you need another language like Java or, you

224
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,790
know, Haskell or whatever it is, you'll realize that a lot of the foundations that you've

225
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,250
built up, you know what we're talking about before, the branch and the trunk, you have all of that

226
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:46,490
already because you already understand how variables work, what data types are, how methods work out,

227
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:54,560
how to parse, how to pass, how you can pass messages around and all of these things will be there.

228
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,320
So you're just putting on those decorations, those little, you know, Christmas baubles, right?

229
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,700
You don't have to learn everything from scratch.

230
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,290
And it's a lot quicker and a lot easier for any future development ambitions you have.

231
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,250
So looking back on my student days, one of the courses that really impacted me actually was I did a

232
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,089
neuroscience degree in addition to my medical degree.

233
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,520
And one of the courses within that degree was computational neuroscience.

234
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:29,450
And it was all about reinforcement learning, supervised, unsupervised learning, basically how we

235
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:32,860
can use computers to simulate what we know about the brain.

236
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,260
And it was so, so fascinating.

237
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:45,860
And that really reignited my interest in computing and I.T. and technology and got me back programming

238
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,290
and, you know, really realizing something that I loved a long time ago as well.

239
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:59,870
So what I would recommend is that if you're taking a degree at a university, really go for courses

240
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:05,420
that have some breadth. When you get out into the real world, whether you're going to get a job or whether

241
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,670
if you're going to work in startup or you're going to, you know, be a founder, the thing that you

242
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:18,800
realize is that, you know, getting an A or getting, you know, 100% on one of your tests don't

243
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,610
matter as much as you think it does when you're a student.

244
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,570
But the things that matter in real life are, you know, your breadth of knowledge, and university can

245
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,830
be great at introducing you to things that you never even realized that you needed to learn.

246
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:44,390
So, you know, a big part of putting together this course was putting together the curriculum of things

247
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:50,300
that I thought were really essential to, you know, somebody who's learning development or on their

248
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,110
journey to becoming a developer.

249
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,670
So and then the tutorials were really built around all of those fundamental things that I wanted to

250
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,070
teach.

251
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,910
So at university, it's a similar thing.

252
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:08,150
You have an expert, you know, your professor who's putting together this course based on things

253
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,790
that they know are important, which you might not have any clue about.

254
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,970
And as great as online learning is, and there are so many really amazing YouTube tutorials, the thing

255
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,400
that it falls down on is not building that curriculum for you.

256
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,540
And university is very good at doing that.

257
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,880
So,

258
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:35,210
I would cherish your time there, so I'm sure many people won't agree with me on this, but I would

259
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,030
say don't aim for perfection in your grades.

260
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:46,580
Just try to meet as many people as you can and have a great experience and learn a large breadth of knowledge

261
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:53,570
rather than trying to memorize everything and, you know, aim for that 100%

262
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,110
or aim for those high grades.

263
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,750
I mean, that's certainly something that I was tempted towards and I would say fell down on, so.

264
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,490
All right.

265
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,650
So the next question is from Abhiji Sarode.

266
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:13,850
I have a feeling that my team are pulling some sort of prank on me by selecting all the questions that

267
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:16,070
have very difficult-to-pronounce names.

268
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:16,970
All right.

269
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,240
So let's see what Abhijit says. Okay. 

270
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,200
Hey, Angela, what's your approach to learning new technology?

271
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,810
What do you do when you get stuck while learning new stuff?

272
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,500
What are some timesaving hacks you use while developing?

273
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:30,980
All right.

274
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,420
So that's a lot of questions there.

275
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:41,060
Firstly is that working in tech means that you are constantly having to learn new things. If you stay

276
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,640
still

277
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:48,440
Technology does not and you will become outdated. Even if you are an 18-year-old and you know about the

278
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,820
coolest technology.

279
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,910
You know, I come across so many React native developers who, you know, became React native developers

280
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:56,600
a year ago

281
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,360
and they're getting really cushy and really comfortable with that one technology and not wanting to

282
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,430
diversify or look at anything else.

283
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,300
The important thing is that you always have to be learning.

284
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:18,620
So what I try to do is try to consistently allocate an amount of time every single day for learning

285
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,660
something that I'm not comfortable with.

286
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:29,420
So for me, because I have the luxury of allocating my own time from 9 AM, so start of the workday,

287
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:37,820
to 11 AM is two hours that are blocked out just for learning and there for learning things I'm not

288
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,410
good at.

289
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:45,770
And it's really, really important to make yourself get into these uncomfortable situations where you

290
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:54,200
have to perform or you have to do something that you don't know very well or that you are not an expert

291
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,620
in,

292
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,000
right?

293
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,950
So for me, that means getting up to date with new technologies,

294
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,870
for example, recently our company collaborated with Amazon to build a Alexa tutorial.

295
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,680
So how you can use NodeJS to create Alexa skills.

296
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:16,490
And in order to build this entire thing for Amazon, I basically had to brush up on a lot of stuff that

297
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,380
I wasn't that comfortable with.

298
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,500
So I think, you know, the saying that if you don't learn, you die.

299
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,150
It's really, really true.

300
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,150
Maybe you don't physically die, but your brain does.

301
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,670
And I see this with, you know, a lot of people.

302
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,250
So, you know, they're always looking for the next relaxing thing to do or, you know, the next holiday

303
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:34,850
to go on

304
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,560
and there's nothing wrong with that.

305
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,360
But in order to improve and in order to get better, you have to look for struggle.

306
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,690
And the more that you struggle, the better that you get.

307
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,340
And so one of the things that I look for in life constantly is a struggle,

308
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,910
you know. Where can I apply myself that I'm not comfortable with?

309
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,880
And I also look for situations where people ask me to do something, hey, you know, can you give this

310
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,920
talk to 3,000 people?

311
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,690
It's tomorrow, by the way.

312
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,050
And yeah, it's recorded for posterity.

313
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,840
So in these situations where you think to yourself, "Oh, my God, I can't do that."

314
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,390
That's really... that's awful.

315
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,180
I can't do that.

316
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,950
No way.

317
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:23,270
Those are the moments where if you do say yes, you stand to learn and gain the most.

318
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:23,990
All right.

319
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,200
So back on track, what do you do when you're learning something new?

320
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,140
So the first thing I do is look for similarities to things that I already know.

321
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,260
So, for example, developing for Amazon Alexa, I was already pretty comfortable with NodeJS.

322
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,050
So it was more a matter of getting used to their APIs and the incredibly poor documentation.

323
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,490
But finding the things that I already knew meant that, you know, I could start hanging my branches

324
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,390
onto my trunks and hanging my leaves onto my branches.

325
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,020
And this does not just apply to programming.

326
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:04,850
Of course, you know, when I was learning how to wind board, I was looking at and remembering

327
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,530
you know, how similar this was to windsurfing, which I really knew how to do.

328
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,050
So look for those parts of the new skill which you already sort of have a little bit of.

329
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,820
For example, if you already know French and you're trying to learn Spanish, you know, a lot of the

330
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,610
words are really quite similar.

331
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:27,020
And so if you first start by identifying those parts that you already know and those parts you

332
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,610
really are comfortable with,

333
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:34,240
and then you can use that to build upon and start extending into this new skill.

334
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:34,870
All right.

335
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,780
So the next question comes from Misha Espinoza.

336
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,100
"I'd like to know your habits to stay productive.

337
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,940
What do you do and what do you avoid and how to implement a system to stay focused"

338
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,200
OK, so, Misha, you have asked a question that is very close to my heart.

339
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,870
This is something I think about almost on a daily basis.

340
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:04,340
I'm trying to optimize my daily routines so that I can be as effective as possible.

341
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,600
So one of the first things that you realize is that we are being distracted

342
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:17,170
as you know, people living in 2017, we are constantly at the beck and call

343
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,250
of notifications.

344
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:25,270
So, you know, I have an Apple Watch, I have a phone, I have my laptop, which are all connected

345
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,650
to the Internet, and they all try to ping me all the time.

346
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,440
And people are always in demand of your time.

347
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:39,820
So you have to be really, really almost militant about protecting that time and protecting your attention

348
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,220
span.

349
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:50,320
So what I do is when I'm working on something creative or when I'm programming, I turn off all notifications

350
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,020
on my phone, on my watch, on my laptop.

351
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:58,540
If I'm doing a project and something I'm really comfortable with, say iOS development, I will actually pull

352
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,190
the plug on the Internet as well

353
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,660
if I'm not testing or if I'm not using any services. It just means that you get to protect that precious

354
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,330
focus that you have and not have to spend your attention on anything else.

355
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,050
So the other thing is definitely attention.

356
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:25,210
So I look at attention as you having a set number of blocks, say you know, it's like if you have ten

357
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,540
dollars to spend every day, it's the same thing with attention.

358
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,060
You probably have ten blocks of attention to spend every day.

359
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,550
And if you waste that on things that are inconsequential, like, you know, figuring what am I going

360
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,860
to eat in the morning or what am I going to wear, then you're already using up attention blocks, right?

361
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,970
And you have to be really, really stingy with your attention in order to do stuff and be productive

362
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,400
and, you know, be creative or do things that are worth bringing into the world.

363
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,810
So one of the things is that in the morning, I don't choose what I wear.

364
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,560
I have a lot of shirts that are pretty much identical.

365
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,190
And I just pick out the same colored shirt. And I just pick out something that's

366
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,630
clean, that pretty much look the same as what I wore yesterday.

367
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,840
And I eat pretty much the same thing every single morning, which is just a tin of sardines.

368
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,050
So high protein, low carbohydrates, good for focus.

369
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:30,730
And then that means that I've managed to get through the beginning of my day without having to make

370
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,740
any decisions at all.

371
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:39,010
And that helps me conserve my attention, energy that I can use on creating app or thinking about how

372
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,250
to explain, you know, certain difficult concepts for you guys.

373
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,350
And it just means that you're so much more purposeful with your attention rather than just, you know,

374
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,540
wasting it and giving it out everywhere.

375
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,290
All right.

376
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:55,510
So the next question is from Stephanie Kendall and she says, "Angela, thank you so much for creating

377
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,650
this course. I was very excited to see a female teaching this class, too.

378
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:05,410
That leads me to my AMA question, do you face any specific challenges being a female in this industry?

379
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,030
Any encouragement or advice to women pursuing a career as a developer?"

380
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,490
OK, cool.

381
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,840
That is a really good question.

382
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,000
And I literally just flew back from Beijing a few days ago giving a talk to 3,000 people on

383
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,870
this exact topic.

384
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,010
So I remember what I said about earlier on? Somebody asking you to do something tomorrow?

385
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:28,420
Yeah, that was it.

386
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,900
But this is something that I get asked quite often and here is how I think about this problem.

387
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:41,550
So throughout life, you will come across many rejections, many bad things that happen to you, people

388
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,700
treating you unfairly or people not giving you what you want.

389
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,860
You know, you not achieving the things that you want because, you know, there's somebody in your

390
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,720
way and you can interpret this in any way you choose.

391
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,090
So, for example, I've been to many interviews where I've been rejected, as have everybody,

392
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:01,390
right?

393
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:11,290
So there was a great story from Jack Ma, the founder of the Ali Group, like probably billionaire

394
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,120
Trillionaire, whatever he is.

395
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,310
But he once applied for a job in the U.S. to work in KFC.

396
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,150
And I think out of 21 people who applied, 20 people got the job and he was the one that

397
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,640
did not.

398
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,630
So you can interpret any of these like

399
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,610
events or things that happen to you in any way you choose.

400
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:39,840
So I've been to a lot of interviews where I've been rejected. And it's very easy and it's very tempting

401
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,830
to think about it in a way like, oh, you know, it's because I'm a woman,

402
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,540
it's because I'm Asian,

403
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,660
it's because I'm not, you know, it's because I'm too young.

404
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,830
it's because I'm too old or a whole bunch of things.

405
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,190
But at the end of the day, that doesn't help anybody.

406
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,300
That doesn't help you,

407
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,830
certainly, you know, I can't change my gender.

408
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,830
I can't change my age or my ethnicity, at least not easily.

409
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,050
So why make it about that,

410
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:13,600
rght?

411
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:20,130
I can honestly say that I guess I've been lucky or I guess the way that I see the world, I've never

412
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,970
felt discriminated in any job that I've ever done.

413
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,910
But I mean, that doesn't mean I haven't had horrible bosses or haven't had people who've been mean

414
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,650
or people who rejected me or, you know, denied me of things I wanted.

415
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:42,330
But I didn't make that about my gender or my ethnicity or anything like that.

416
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:49,740
You know, I realized that sometimes I didn't get the job maybe because I wasn't suited, and other

417
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,820
times because maybe I was partying until 1 AM in the morning and I didn't have time to prepare,

418
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,190
right?

419
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,460
And in which case I don't deserve the job.

420
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,770
It didn't matter if I was a white male in my 40s, I still wouldn't have deserved that job,

421
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:04,990
right?

422
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:11,250
So I think it's far more empowering to think about these problems or, you know, things that happen

423
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,080
to you that aren't desirable in a way that you can control,

424
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,590
right?

425
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,830
I can control how much I prep for an interview.

426
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:26,070
I can control how hard I work to understand, you know, their business. Or, you know, for technical

427
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,850
interviews,

428
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,450
I can choose to spend more time and, you know, be the best or polish up my portfolio. All of these

429
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:39,840
kind of things that are way more helpful than just, you know, thinking to yourself that it might be

430
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,390
because of something that you can't change.

431
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:46,530
But, you know, I'm not saying that there aren't problems in the world.

432
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,630
Of course there are.

433
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,310
And, you know, we do have to tackle them using policy and all of these things.

434
00:31:53,310 --> 00:32:00,750
But on a more personal level, it's way more helpful if you choose to interpret these events in a way

435
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,960
that you can change and that is within your own control.

436
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:12,060
So my words of encouragement for any woman or man or child or anybody really going into development

437
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,930
is that, you know, look for commonalities that you have with people.

438
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,780
For example, in our current company, we're way more divided by, you know, Android versus iOS or

439
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:30,420
Mac versus PC or Rick versus Morty than we are, you know, by our genders or colors

440
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,930
and it's because, you know, we choose to interpret it that way.

441
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,580
So make your own choices.

442
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,690
It's your own stage.

443
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:41,490
You decide where you put the limelight and focus on things that you can change rather than things that

444
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,340
you can't change.

445
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,050
All right.

446
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:48,960
So I've been recording for quite a while, and there is literally nobody left in the office anymore.

447
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,910
So I will try and keep the short and I'll put some of these questions on the next AMA.

448
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,740
But let's answer this last one from Bonn

449
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,350
Elimanco.

450
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,330
That was not a bad attempt,

451
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:03,630
right?

452
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,130
And what is your morning ritual?

453
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:07,440
All right.

454
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,430
So what I do in the morning? This is an ideal day.

455
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,350
This is not every single day as much as I would love it to be something,

456
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,600
sometimes things just happen in life.

457
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,680
Sometimes I'm on a flight and I feel horrible.

458
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,850
So the thing with morning ritual is that people don't tell you is, you know, don't feel bad for missing

459
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,830
a few days or screwing up here and there.

460
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,890
It's the it's the trying that counts,

461
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,190
right?

462
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:42,660
So I wake up usually around 6:30 AM or 7 AM and the first thing I do is ten press-ups, proper press-

463
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,580
ups. None of this, you know, sort of wingy girl press-up stuff, stuff like proper press-ups.

464
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,150
And that kind of gets the blood going and makes me feel a lot more awake and less likely to go back

465
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,810
in bed,

466
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,140
right?

467
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,480
I think I think once you've got shoes on, it's a lot harder to get back into bed.

468
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,460
So after that I meditate for about twenty minutes.

469
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,489
So that means I set a timer for twenty minutes, during which time I tried desperately to not think

470
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:14,040
about what am I going to eat, what am I going to eat, what am I going to eat?

471
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,940
Some days it is just like that and I can't help it. By now

472
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,310
if you guys have watched a lot of the videos in my course, you'll realize that I think about food a

473
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:23,790
lot.

474
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,739
But I also go to the gym a lot.

475
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,489
So it's OK.

476
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:27,840
There's always going to be...

477
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:28,480
it's got to be

478
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,530
balance in life, right?

479
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:38,880
Everybody has to have something they're into. So, I meditate for 20 minutes. So personally I do TM,

480
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,420
transcendental meditation, it seems to me like the one type of meditation where you don't have to

481
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,760
believe in a lot of stuff.

482
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,310
So I find that quite helpful.

483
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:58,350
And I think over the years of meditating, I've definitely found that you've become a way more purposeful

484
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:58,900
person.

485
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,770
So it's very easy when you're aggravated by people such as certain clients, you know.

486
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:13,660
That design, I don't know how I feel about this app, I feel like it's not quite there yet.

487
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,600
I'm like, OK, I'm glad that you feel so much.

488
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,260
But anyways, yeah.

489
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,550
So sometimes you are prone to automatic responses where you just get angry or get annoyed or, you know,

490
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,560
don't like what you're hearing.

491
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,510
But I think with meditation is far more it allows you to be outside your own body and look at yourself

492
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,570
doing these things or interacting with people.

493
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,790
And, you know, you sort of ask yourself, like, if I react this way, does it help me, does it

494
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:46,810
hinder me,

495
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,470
does it give me any benefit?

496
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:55,930
And usually the answer to all of these instantaneous instant gratification type of responses or lashing

497
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,670
out, you know, it's never really useful.

498
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,270
So meditation has been great for that.

499
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:07,480
So then after I meditate, I try to do a little bit of journaling about just, you know, just basically

500
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,170
brain dump.

501
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,340
Any thoughts that I've got in my head.

502
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,490
It's very easy to be varying in your head, you know.. that I tried to put it down on paper and once on paper

503
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,110
I can tell myself, oh, it's there.

504
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,470
You know, I don't have to worry about it anymore.

505
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,350
Somebody else, namely my notebook, is taking care of the worrying for me.

506
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,180
And that usually takes about 10, 15 minutes.

507
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:38,770
And then the next thing is, I bring up Medium or Hacker News or Product Hunt and look at what's happening

508
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,810
in the world in terms of tech.

509
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:49,120
Look at some of the interesting tech news, things that people build, new GitHub repos, just basically

510
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,780
news.

511
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,970
And I eat my kind of sardines alongside that.

512
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,840
So that's basically my morning routine.

513
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,180
It obviously changes quite a bit.

514
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:08,140
I would love to be able to add a little bit more exercise to it, but with current experimentation,

515
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,720
it doesn't seem to have benefited me all that much.

516
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,330
So it's constantly in flux.

517
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:19,960
And, certainly my morning routine this year has been different from last year and last.

518
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,980
But I'm constantly trying to squeeze out that extra bit of productivity.

519
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:31,930
So if you guys are interested in productivity hacks, which I am hugely interested in, I wrote this

520
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:38,060
article, which I can link in this video to some of the hacks I found that were really, really useful.

521
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,750
All right, cool.

522
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,230
So my tummy is rumbling and I'm going to go and grab something to eat.

523
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,190
The office is now completely deserted.

524
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:53,070
It's just myself talking to myself, which everybody is obviously used to.

525
00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:00,490
So I look forward to answering more of your questions in next month's AMA.

526
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm going to be sending out the newsletter as well later perhaps this week or next week.

527
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,010
So keep your eyes peeled for that.

528
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,500
If you haven't signed up, then go ahead and sign up for it.

529
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,160
It's full of terrible jokes that I've thought of, as well as some of the articles I've read, I've come

530
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,100
across, that are really good in terms of our iOS programming, app design, a whole bunch of interesting

531
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,400
stuff.

532
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:32,470
So if you have a question for the next AMA, then just go and find the most recent announcement and

533
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,550
add your question there and I will have a look at it.

534
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:43,180
And my team will pick out some choice ones that maybe I haven't answered in this one for the next session.

535
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:50,710
But meanwhile, I hope you guys are all doing great. Looking at the Q&A sections and looking at some

536
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,800
of the things that you guys have been emailing me that you've built,

537
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,410
I think everybody seems to be doing a great job and just want to say, keep going.

538
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,670
I'm here for you in the Q&A section as well as on AMAs and also in the newsletters I send out.

539
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,190
And, you know, don't if you get stuck, don't give up.

540
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,540
Just keep going or ask a question or go on to Stack Overflow and, you know, power through and you

541
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,160
will eventually get there.

542
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,190
And I look forward to seeing more of all of the awesome things that you guys have been building or are

543
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:34,750
going to build and publishing it and shouting all about it to all to everybody I know and all my students.

544
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,670
So good luck and I'll see you back in the course and maybe next month as well.

545
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,540
All right.

546
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,320
Bye, guys.
