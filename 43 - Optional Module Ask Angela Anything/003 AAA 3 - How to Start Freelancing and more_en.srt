00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,620
Hello, everyone, and welcome to yet another episode of Ask Angela Anything, and you guys have spoken

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,660
and my team have selected some pretty choice questions, I would say, and I'm really excited to be

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,680
able to answer them in today's episode.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,770
So, as you may notice, today is a very special episode because I am hailing from Nairobi in Kenya.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,400
And as you can see, it is absolutely beautiful out here

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,070
and there's just birdsong and monkeys running around.

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:34,590
So gone are the traffic sounds and the usual London pollution of my office.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,000
I hope today will be a scenic change to brighten your day.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,440
So once you're ready, let's get started.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,250
Now, the first question is from Virak Ngauv.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,150
This shouldn't be called Ask Angela Anything.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,300
It should be called Angela murdering people's names.

13
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,680
So Virak asks, do you have any advice for somebody who's looking to start freelancing?

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,630
All right.

15
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,230
So you may or may not know, but I learned how to code when I was younger,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,590
and I have been programming on the site for many, many years.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,830
But I actually trained to be a medical doctor.

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,510
So during that time and during med school, I spent a lot of time freelancing.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,380
So I hope I'm more than qualified to answer this question for you Virak.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,420
The first thing I would say is that don't jump in.

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't, you know, despite what people say, don't just dive into freelancing, quit your job, tell your

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,790
boss that he's a dick and then just go and, you know, try and find a job. That's really bad.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,680
Even though the traditional image of an entrepreneur is someone who likes to take risks, that's actually

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,610
really not true.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,430
If you think about Richard Branson when he started Virgin Atlantic, he didn't just go out and, you

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,040
know, buy lots of planes.

27
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,060
In fact, he actually leased a plane from Boeing to get started.

28
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,710
And that meant that if it was successful, then great, he could continue doing this.

29
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,040
But if it failed, then he could just give it back and his investment wouldn't suffer.

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,530
So don't quit your job straight away.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,169
Instead, what you should do is try to figure out what spare time you have during the week and try to

32
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:17,230
carve out about 15 hours per week that you're going to dedicate to building a pet project.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,840
Now, the important thing about this pet project, it doesn't really matter what you build, but what

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,810
matters is that it has to be useful to at least one person so that one person can be you,

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,420
it can be your wife, it can be your pet.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,790
It doesn't matter, but it has to be useful.

37
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,880
It can't just be a hello world application or something that you used to learn about a particular API,

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,520
for example.

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:45,090
Now, once you've done that and you've deployed it onto either the Web or if you're building an app,

40
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,860
then obviously onto the app stores, then you've started building a portfolio.

41
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,100
And this is going to be a great thing that you can show everybody, potential employers or potential

42
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,930
clients, that this is what you're capable of.

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,690
So this is the beginning.

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,490
So now at this stage, you are spending 15 hours a week building your pet project.

45
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,400
And once you've started doing this, the next step is to carve out another 12 to 15 hours.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,500
Now, nobody said that this was going to be easy.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,830
Freelancing is not easy.

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,220
Nothing that's worth doing

49
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,790
is easy

50
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,540
in fact. Now you're on to step two and you're carving out 15 hours per week, which you're going to

51
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,330
spend working on other people's projects.

52
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,720
So you're going to be freelancing on small gigs.

53
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:36,840
So the best place to start, I recommend, is a website called Fiverr, and I'll include the links in

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,600
the resources section of this episode.

55
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,870
But basically it's a website where somebody can get a job done for maybe $5-$20 dollars.

56
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,830
Now, the important thing here is that you're not here to make money.

57
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,920
You're here to get skills, and you're here to learn about the world of freelancing. Just as you probably

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,280
wouldn't let a surgeon operate on you if they haven't had any experience before, as a freelancer or as

59
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,270
a web developer or an app developer,

60
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,540
people need to be able to see what you've done in the past, how you were able to work with clients

61
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,930
and have people who can give you good testimonials.

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,250
That kind of stuff is really, really important in your career as a freelancer.

63
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:25,170
So the first step I recommend is getting started with small things on Fiverr and don't take on projects

64
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,200
that will take you any longer than a week, to start with.

65
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,340
And another place you can look at is a place called oDesk and Upwork.

66
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,150
And you could start building up your profiles on those websites and start answering to some of the requests.

67
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,310
And again, don't go for something ambitious. Even though, you know, the larger projects obviously

68
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,090
pay more,

69
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,330
the important thing here is still about getting experience.

70
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:55,110
So you're looking for projects that basically larger freelancing firms or agencies don't really want

71
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,830
to take up.

72
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,850
So these are things like bug fixes or things like updates

73
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,740
or maintenance or small improvements, not going to make you a millionaire, but it will start earning

74
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,250
money and along the way you will gain really, really valuable experience.

75
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,360
So that's what it's all about.

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,190
Now, once you've been working with a couple of clients, some of them, if they enjoyed working with

77
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:25,460
you because you are communicative and I can't stress enough how important it is to be able to communicate

78
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,130
well with your clients as a freelancer. It's probably the one thing that will make or break your career.

79
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:37,250
Give your clients regular updates to show them what you've done and explain what it is that you're doing.

80
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,860
It's really important that they understand how much work you're doing and also how you're trying to

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,700
do a really great job for them.

82
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:51,980
So as you do this, you will start to build up a client list, people who will ask you for other things

83
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,010
that they want done as well, and you will get word of mouth.

84
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,350
And as this goes along, you'll end up with a list of clients who will give you jobs, who will give

85
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,890
you good reviews or testimonials, or be able to act as a reference for you for future jobs. And with

86
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,780
your portfolio,

87
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:12,680
remember those 15 hours a week that's going towards those pet projects? That's going to be building your

88
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,300
portfolio and with the experience that you're getting with your clients, and that's going to help you

89
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,350
network and getting more people interested in getting you to work for them.

90
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,350
And now, at this stage, congratulations.

91
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,550
You're a freelancer.

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,420
You've made it.

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,120
And from this point onward, you're going to start to work on larger and larger projects, perhaps collaborate

94
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,980
on some projects with other programmers.

95
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,440
But as always, the first part is hardest.

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,200
And once you've gotten over those hurdles, you will be on your way to becoming a fully-fledged and

97
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,310
hopefully a really, really in demand, a freelance web developer or app developer.

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,280
So I wish you the best of luck Virak, and I hope you have an awesome time as a freelance developer.

99
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,470
All right.

100
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,290
So on to the next question.

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,000
This is a question from Amit Singh and he asks, What does your daily schedule look like?

102
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,640
OK, so the first thing I'm going to say is that what I'm about to tell you is probably an ideal day.

103
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,380
I travel a lot because I give talks.

104
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,560
So, for example, right now I'm in Nairobi because I'm giving a talk.

105
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:26,690
So this is the daily schedule of a day where I'm based in London and I don't have anything special planned

106
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,820
for the day.

107
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,470
So I think in one of the the previous AMAs

108
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,070
I talked about my morning routine, so I'm not going to cover that part.

109
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:39,590
If you're interested, have a look at one of the previous ones and you'll find the answer there.

110
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,970
But I'm going to start from about 9 o'clock, which is where I tend to start work.

111
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:51,240
So for the first hour and a half of the day, so 9:00 until 10:30, I spend on learning stuff.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,010
Now this sometimes becomes one hour, sometimes it's two hours.

113
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,980
It's really dependent on what I'm trying to do.

114
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,040
I want to be able to have enough time so that I haven't just gotten started

115
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,690
and I have to switch to another task.

116
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,850
But I'm more of a morning person.

117
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,460
I'm very alert during the mornings

118
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,890
and I'm capable of doing the most creative work during that time.

119
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,320
So that's the time period that I tend to allocate to learning new things.

120
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,910
So, for example, this morning I spent learning and digging more into Selenium Webdriver because

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,770
I had written a postscript from God knows how long ago, which basically I'm not even sure I should

122
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,500
share this with you, but it's a script that basically renews my library books automatically.

123
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,790
So once it gets to two days before the due date, then it will renew my books without me having to do

124
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,230
it because I'm terrible at remembering things unless it's in my calendar.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,780
So that was a hack that I wrote a while ago.

126
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,690
But there's a lot of people who've been asking me how to do it,

127
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,690
and rather than teaching them Pearl, which is just like torture, I thought it might be a good idea

128
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,390
to teach people how to use Selenium Webdriver.

129
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:13,790
So, for example, I'm using it to book the gym classes that I tend to go to and also I'm trying to

130
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,540
get it to renew the books that I have in the library.

131
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,280
So that's what I was doing this morning,

132
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,950
but it could be anything really.

133
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:27,230
It's basically something new that you want to learn and you should dedicate a block of time when you

134
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,990
are at your best to do it.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,470
Now, that tends to be the morning for most people, but I know that there's a lot of night owls.

136
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,300
So it could be that for you, maybe that's, you know, 12:00 midday, but basically spend an hour and

137
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,330
a half during your best time to learn something.

138
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,360
I think that's really, really worthwhile.

139
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,740
Now, after that block, I tend to do more creative work.

140
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,270
So high again,

141
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,750
high

142
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,280
brain demand kind of work.

143
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:59,480
So that includes things like developing new lesson plans for you guys and 

144
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,490
also working on a new curriculum or working on a development project. Those are things that require

145
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,430
high cognitive function, which I tend to have less and less of as I go towards the end of the day.

146
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,820
So that's the morning basically done.

147
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,560
And then maybe I'll spend about half an hour on lunch, try to eat and trying to eat something that's

148
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,890
not so carb-heavy so that I can stay awake during the afternoon.

149
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,630
And then I would normally go for a walk for maybe 30 minutes to an hour.

150
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,380
And very often in our company, we tend to do walking meetings.

151
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:40,420
So we'll just take the whole team and we'd walk and talk and hash things out, because I find that when

152
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,750
people are sat down in a meeting room, everything is very slow.

153
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,170
And I think when you're walking, I have long legs and I tend to set the pace.

154
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:53,290
So I think when everybody's walking really fast, they seem to get out of breath and need to talk really

155
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,090
fast, which I really like.

156
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,260
So trying to mold your environment to suit your highest productivity.

157
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,620
Then after the walk, I tend to work on some slightly less cognitively demanding tasks, for example,

158
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,850
video editing or meetings with clients and those kind of things.

159
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,270
And then finally, from four o'clock to five o'clock is my email time

160
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,200
and that's the only time during the day when I check my email.

161
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,430
So I find that with notifications, it's very much a pulling process.

162
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,420
You're being pulled by the world into whatever needs they have or whatever demands they have.

163
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:35,170
But it's much better for you to decide when you want to check email or when you want to address issues

164
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,160
from other people.

165
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,480
So essentially you can protect yourself just by switching off notifications.

166
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,210
And in fact, my phone probably stays in airplane mode for a good...

167
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:54,160
so I usually switch off airplane mode at 1 PM, and I tend to switch it back on around 6:30 PM or

168
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,310
7 PM. So I'm not even really testing the battery life of the iPhone because it's only being switched

169
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,320
on for maybe six hours a day.

170
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,080
But it does help me get a lot of -- done, which is the important part,

171
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,360
right?

172
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,350
So after about 5 PM, I tend to wind down or, you know, finish off the things I need to finish

173
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:20,010
off and just see if anybody else in the team needs any help or anything like that.

174
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,050
And then I would probably have dinner around 7:00, I guess.

175
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,440
And then after dinner, what I do depends on, again, my cognitive abilities.

176
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:38,320
So when I have basically no cognitive abilities, then I would maybe play video games or watch something.

177
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,940
You know, how like you have HP, this is when like HP is or mental points are at like minimum.

178
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,980
One of my favorite games I'm playing at the moment is called SUPERHOT.

179
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,820
And the idea is basically that as you move, time moves with you.

180
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,640
So I can't really do it justice.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,570
I recommend just checking it out on YouTube, but it's a really cool game.

182
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,860
I'm really enjoying it.

183
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,920
If I have slightly more cognitive capabilities, then I'll probably read a book, usually non-fiction

184
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,820
up to about nine o'clock and then after nine o'clock, it's only fiction.

185
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,220
And if I have a lot of brain power left, then I like to play a game of go.

186
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,480
I don't know how many of guys have ever played this game.

187
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,070
I think it's called Baduk in Korean and it's called Weichi in Chinese.

188
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:38,620
But it's a fantastic game and it's so simple in terms of the rules, and yet it's so complex in terms

189
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,110
of all of the moves that you can make.

190
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,900
So that's something that I recommend.

191
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:50,590
So I know that this whole answer has been pretty much centered around how much cognitive capability

192
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,220
I have.

193
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,470
I think I'm making myself sound a lot like a robot: "if battery life

194
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,070
high,

195
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,270
do this.

196
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,160
If RAM low, do that." I hope I don't come across as a robot.

197
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,790
But yeah, so that's pretty much my daily schedule.

198
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,860
If you have any productivity hacks or, you know, something that you do in your daily schedule that

199
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,340
you think is really awesome has really helped you, then please do either hit me up on Twitter so 

200
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:27,100
@yu_angela or comment below or in the Q&A section and let me know. I'm always open to new

201
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,550
ideas.

202
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,240
All right.

203
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,630
So the next question comes from Pascal Heimlicher.

204
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,030
I really hope that was a good enough pronunciation.

205
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,050
I tried really hard. And he asks, What do you think about cross-platform versus native app development?

206
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,350
I have a lot of ideas on this because I get asked this question pretty much on a daily basis from students.

207
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,890
But it's a really good question because there's a point in time where I would have said, "Don't even think

208
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,970
about cross-platform.

209
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,650
It's just not worth it.

210
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,650
Just stick to native development and your golden."

211
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,750
But actually, you know, more and more so these days, especially with new technology, new frameworks

212
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,980
like React native, it's actually not so bad.

213
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,880
Now, let's just talk about some of the pros and cons, OK?

214
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,510
So the pros of native app development is that it's the gold standard.

215
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,940
Basically, if you're a large company flush with cash, you're going to be going down the native route.

216
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,020
No question asked.

217
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,340
It is the best still hands down.

218
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,740
Other pros include that it's fast.

219
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:37,490
If you need animations, if you have graphics in your app, then you probably should stick to Native.

220
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,550
When you're using something that's really graphics intensive

221
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,240
then the cross-platform apps do show. Other things are things like you have access to exclusive APIs,

222
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,660
for example, things like push notification, or if you want to tap into a health kit on the iPhone,

223
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:59,270
then those modules are generally not available, at least not easily through cross-platform means.

224
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,980
And the other thing is that if you're watching this video, then you're probably taking my iOS Swift

225
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:11,520
course and you would know that there's a lot more resources for native development than for cross-platform.

226
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,430
There are more people who are able to answer your questions on Stack Overflow, more results for your

227
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,630
queries on Google,

228
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,250
and there's even the Apple developer forum to help you.

229
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,260
So there's a lot of help out there if you are going down the native route compared to cross-platform.

230
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,870
Now, the biggest con for going down the native route is that if you want an Android app, you need

231
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,890
a complete rewrite.

232
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,530
There is basically zero reusability of your code and of your UI designs.

233
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,250
So it's painful, it's expensive and it's time consuming.

234
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,920
And you'll notice that most apps will launch on iOS first before they go down the Android route.

235
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,960
And even if they are on both platforms, new features tend to come out on iOS first.

236
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,990
It's just a resource constraint that most people have, even large companies like Snapchat.

237
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,640
You'll see that features come to iOS first.

238
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:10,849
So it's expensive because time equals money and it's and you need a lot more developers, a large development

239
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:13,450
team, more people to manage, more people to pay.

240
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,230
It's just more expensive.

241
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:21,619
And the other thing is that if you yourself already have a good command of a particular language that's

242
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:28,610
not Swift or Java, say you are a web developer and you know JavaScript or say your .Net guy and

243
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,990
you know all about C#.

244
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:37,370
If you're using cross-platform tools, for example, PhoneGap, Accelerator or Córdova, then you can

245
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,590
use those existing skills that you have.

246
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,860
And all you need to know is learn about the modules, the frameworks, the APIs.

247
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:49,280
And that's a lot less painful than picking up a new language from scratch.

248
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:56,480
Although I would argue that, you know, as developers, we've basically signed up to lifelong learning.

249
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,000
There's probably a new JavaScript framework every single week, as far as I can tell.

250
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,800
And it's cool,

251
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,460
it's fun.

252
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,250
I really enjoy learning new things.

253
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,920
But if you don't, then that can also be quite a big downside of native.

254
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:19,220
Now, the sort of halfway point or in between is something like React native, which is a framework that's

255
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,730
open-source, but it has a dodgy licensing and it was created by Facebook.

256
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:31,280
Now, the great thing about React native is that it offers a lot of the native features and it allows

257
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,840
you to use the language that you're familiar with to code both Android and iOS.

258
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,180
It has a whole bunch of modules that cuts down your development time because you can use them across

259
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,160
Android and iOS.

260
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,420
Now, it's not completely developed once and deploy everywhere because it has that native aspect, but

261
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,010
it gets pretty close to it. Now

262
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,280
the downside of React native, probably the biggest one, is that there are some really essential features that

263
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,950
I think their modules lack.

264
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,140
Like, for example, if you want to do something that's actually pretty standard on native iOS, I found

265
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:12,590
that you actually can't do it very easily without creating custom code, which means that you need to

266
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,800
know about Swift and you know about native development

267
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:22,220
anyways. The way that I see React native is that if you are an existing iOS Swift developer

268
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:29,470
who wants to build apps both for Android and iOS, you can use React native and do it more quickly.

269
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:36,410
It's not really the use case for somebody who doesn't really know anything about Swift or iOS to just

270
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,350
pick up and be able to develop for Android and iOS.

271
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,950
The other thing to remember is that because it's developed by Facebook and it has this weird license,

272
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,870
so you guys might have noticed that the most permissive license is the MIT license.

273
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,480
That's basically just do whatever you want with this code.

274
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,950
But Facebook has a weird licensing on both React and React native.

275
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,630
And what it means is that

276
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:07,230
if at some point in the future, your company that uses React or React native decides to sue Facebook,

277
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,770
they can revoke your license to use their framework. So in most cases, none of us have to worry about

278
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,810
suing Facebook.

279
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,360
It's just that's just the level of success that we don't need to worry about until we get there.

280
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,080
But if you are cautious and you know, especially with everything that's been going around about Facebook

281
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,690
lately, I don't know.

282
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,280
It's I think it's definitely a con for me anyways.

283
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:39,230
But in conclusion, I would say that it really depends on the project that you want to build, whether

284
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,320
if you should choose cross-platform or native development.

285
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,920
And, you know, you really have to assess in a case by case scenario. It's really, there's no blanket

286
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,210
rule.

287
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,810
There have been projects where I've used React native to quickly create Android and iOS apps,

288
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,360
there have been times where I've stayed very, very far away from any sort of cross-platform and stuck

289
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,340
to good old native development.

290
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:07,760
Figure out what the project is all about and look at the pros and cons of both and assess on which one

291
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
will be better that way.

292
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:16,430
So a tagged on question from Pascal is, "Are there any helpful tools that you use that makes a developer's

293
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,300
life easier?"

294
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:22,550
And yes, I'm all about the tools, all about the tools, bout the tools.

295
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:31,130
This also should answer your third question, which is when can we expect new music videos from myself

296
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,240
or the London App brewery?

297
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:39,950
And that is never. I am never, ever, ever again making a music video. For those guys who don't know,

298
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:40,580
great!

299
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:48,260
For those guys who do know and have watched my rap music video about app development, I apologize for

300
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,880
polluting your eyes.

301
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:57,530
It was such a bad attempt and anybody who knows me knows that I can't sing for --, so I'm sorry.

302
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,180
And it's never going to happen again.

303
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,380
So but I do have helpful tools.

304
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,890
One of my favorite websites is Product Hunt, and that's probably the first place that I go to for inspiration

305
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,230
to see what new products there are.

306
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,620
If you haven't seen it, check it out.

307
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,910
It's absolutely awesome.

308
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,530
But out of my top tools, I've selected four. First one is an app called Duet.

309
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:28,970
And what it allows you to do is it allows you to set up a separate screen for your laptop or desktop

310
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,060
using your iPad or even your iPhone.

311
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,670
And that basically allows you to have a dual-screen or in my case, a triple screen.

312
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,410
And once you have experienced the joys of dual screening, you will never go back again.

313
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,220
I promise you.

314
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,860
And this is probably the cheapest way of giving it a go, you can reuse your existing hardware, basically.

315
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,350
And it's just an amazing experience.

316
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,630
It's a really good app and I really, really recommend it.

317
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:00,020
The next one is Alfred and many of you guys, especially if been watching if you've been watching my

318
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,670
tutorials for a long time, you would have noticed that I use Alfred pretty much religiously.

319
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,670
And a lot of you ask me why not just use Spotlight?

320
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,690
It does the same thing, right?

321
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:09,320
It doesn't.

322
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,220
It really doesn't.

323
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:16,760
It's firstly much, much faster at indexing because it's selective indexing and it doesn't go through

324
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,840
your entire Mac.

325
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,680
And the other thing is that it tends to pull up more relevant results.

326
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:28,940
You have queries that you can put in there, like Find, which opens the folder or open, which opens

327
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,290
a particular file that you have.

328
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,810
But give it a go and you will never look back.

329
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,800
I promise you as well.

330
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,440
The next one is momento.

331
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,900
So you might have seen it again in my videos.

332
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,510
It's a Chrome plugin that I have which shows a new beautiful image of somewhere in the world that I

333
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:48,380
should probably be traveling to every time you open a new tab.

334
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,640
But it also has a to-do list built-in,

335
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,240
it also has the weather, the time and allows you to focus on one particular task for the day, which

336
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,290
I find really helpful.

337
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,820
So it's a free plug in.

338
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,940
Just, you know, try give it a go and see if you like it.

339
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,590
And the last thing I'm going to talk about is something called Cheat Sheet,

340
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:13,640
which is this amazing piece of software that gives you a cheat sheet of all the shortcuts in whichever

341
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,050
application you are in.

342
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,360
So if you hold down the command button, it will just show you a list of cheat sheets wherever you are.

343
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,940
And it's really, really cool.

344
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,480
Now, the last one I'm going to talk about is not really a good tool, but it's just something I found

345
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
on Product Hunt that I thought was hilarious.

346
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,600
It's called canned emails and it has canned breakup emails,

347
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,230
it has emails

348
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,830
for clients.

349
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:40,430
I've never yet sent one of these because I'm just too scared that somebody else has seen this website.

350
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,550
But it's pretty hilarious and I recommend you checking it out.

351
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,550
So the sun is starting to go down around here.

352
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:52,730
And I'm probably going to go and grab something to eat because I haven't eaten for a whole two hours

353
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,000
now.

354
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,400
But I hope you guys had fun with me in Nairobi in this episode of Ask Angela Anything.

355
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:07,250
And if you have any questions for the next episode, then be sure to leave it below this video

356
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,810
or on one of the new announcements that I make on a regular basis. So I hope you guys are having

357
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:17,000
a great time wherever you are, and that's all from me.

358
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,150
I'll see you next time. Ciao.
