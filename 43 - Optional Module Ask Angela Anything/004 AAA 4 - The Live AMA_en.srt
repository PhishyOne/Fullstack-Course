1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,340
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:17,390
This is Angela from the brewery and I'm so excited to be doing this first ever live AMA.

3
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,300
So for those of you guys who've been with me for the longest, you know that back in the days in the

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:32,360
courses we used to do these live Ask Angela anythings and this is trying to bring it back and see how

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,980
you guys are all doing while you're safely at home.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:44,870
And yeah, so I've never really done anything like this, so I'm a little bit nervous, but hopefully

7
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,420
it's going to go great and I'm going to get to know some more of you guys.

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,530
All right.

9
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:59,900
So the plan is we're going to take a look at some of the questions that were asked ahead of time.

10
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:09,530
So over the last week, you guys have been posting your questions on the ask page and our team has compiled

11
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:14,060
a bunch of the most upvoted questions.

12
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,210
So we're going to tackle some of those and then we're going to tackle some of these YouTube questions

13
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,200
live.

14
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:29,030
And I don't see too much of a delay in the chat, so hopefully I'll be able to get to you and we can

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,040
do a little bit of back and forth.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,670
So.

17
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,820
All right, so here we've got the question from Melissa Santos.

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,000
So I'm just going to answer it all over again, because it seemed like when I went to the slides, you

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,230
couldn't hear me anymore.

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,910
So let's try this again.

21
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,360
So her question is how do you manage to use different languages for different projects without mixing

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
up the syntax?

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,730
All right.

24
00:01:52,730 --> 00:02:00,290
So the first thing I want to say is that I mix up the syntax all the time, especially when I'm working

25
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,050
on like a swift project for a long time.

26
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:09,650
And then I switched to maybe doing a web development project with JavaScript.

27
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,290
Then, you know, I'm going to be missing semicolons.

28
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm going to be just not writing JavaScript code.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,120
But the great thing is that there's good lenders and if you use a good code editor like Atom of Yes

30
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,280
code or Sublime, then they should be able to pick up these things for you.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:36,740
So I kind of let the machine do the machine part and then I do the brain pod, which is the logic.

32
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,060
That's the hardest part.

33
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:48,950
And the first part of her question she actually asked, so is is it a good idea to become fluent in

34
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,790
one language before moving on to other languages?

35
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,040
Now, I think this really depends on what you're trying to do, right?

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,260
If you're trying to build if your end project is an iOS app, then yeah, you definitely, definitely

37
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,770
need to get really good at probably Swift first.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,710
But if you're trying to do something that occasionally requires just a little bit of web development

39
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:30,920
skills or just a little bit of maybe like a flutter multi iOS and Android app, then you could just

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,780
dive into the thing that you need.

41
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:37,550
The way I always see it is these programming languages.

42
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,360
They're not like a subject, they're not like history or geography.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,690
They're more like a tool.

44
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,160
Like you're learning how to use the hammer, you're learning how to use a saw.

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:56,630
You don't have to get to like 100% of hammer ability before you can move on to the next tool.

46
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,560
It all depends on what you're trying to build, right?

47
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,120
All right.

48
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,720
So let's move on to the next question.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,670
All right.

50
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:18,140
So in this question we've got from Jp RD and he's asking, given that coronavirus has affected so many

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:29,570
people and a lot of people are looking for ways of working from home, working remotely online, does

52
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,820
that mean that all the jobs are going to be filled up pretty quickly and, you know, it will be far

53
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,080
more competitive?

54
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,860
And I think I would say that, you know, you have to remember that when anything is desirable, it

55
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,400
is going to be competitive.

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:59,520
So if you think it's a great idea to work from home and, you know, have the flexibility of where you

57
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,020
live, be able to work remotely, then somebody else is going to have that idea as well.

58
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:12,570
But then again, you know, things that are worth doing are probably worth competing for.

59
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,470
It all depends on what is your ultimate goal.

60
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,390
And if your goal is to get a job as a web developer or as an app developer, then you just go to focus

61
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:31,740
on that goal and don't worry so much about what how much competition there is or how many other people

62
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,510
are applying to the same thing.

63
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,320
I mean, I remember back in the days when.

64
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:45,300
So I don't know if you guys know this, but I trained as a medical doctor and I worked as a doctor training

65
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,270
in orthopedic surgery for a number of years.

66
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:57,960
And when I was in medical school, even from like day one, people were telling me that if you want

67
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,560
to become a surgeon, like the chances are something like one in like 1000.

68
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,330
It's just so competitive.

69
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,140
And then within surgery, there's, you know, different competition ratios.

70
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,300
Like if you want to do brain surgery, that's like the most competitive field because there's only so

71
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,650
few brain surgeons.

72
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,170
But if you want to do, I don't know, maybe another type of surgery, maybe it's less competitive.

73
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:31,500
So I think even from that point, I was trained upon this idea that competition is just a way of life.

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,080
You know, you want something, other people want something, and then you just got to focus on yourself.

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:46,470
There's a really great book by Carl Newport, which I really like called So Good, They Can't Ignore

76
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:46,590
You.

77
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,150
I think that's the title anyways.

78
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,110
And I mean, the thing is, you don't really have to read the book.

79
00:06:52,110 --> 00:07:01,080
I mean, it's a good book, but basically most of it is in the title like become so good at whatever

80
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,960
it is you do that they can't ignore you.

81
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:11,780
And they could be your boss, they could be a recruiter, they could be anybody, really.

82
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,970
And this is really something that I've always kept in my mind.

83
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:30,390
Like I've just tried to focus on doing the best job I can, and that means focusing on the student experience,

84
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:41,070
like, how can I make a course that is going to be the most helpful, the most enjoyable and the most

85
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,420
completed, right?

86
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,480
So I focus on these things and I don't really think about what other people are doing.

87
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:57,510
And that means that I have a product that I created and it's just much easier for me to think this way

88
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,450
if I spend all my time thinking about, well, you know, so-and-so is doing this or that person is

89
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:08,160
doing that, then I'm just going to be copying everybody all the time.

90
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,590
And if you guys have taken my courses, you know, that's usually not the way to go.

91
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,880
I mean, that also means that there's a lot of bad jokes in there that are untested and nobody's sanctioned.

92
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,830
And it's probably not a good idea.

93
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,690
But, you know, hey, we've got to try things right.

94
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,080
All right.

95
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,900
Let's move on to the next question.

96
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:34,900
All right.

97
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,850
So this question is from Mayank Saini.

98
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,960
I hope I pronounce that.

99
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,590
Okay.

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,420
I think I'm just going to be murdering people's names because I'm going to be bad at pronouncing eating.

101
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,050
So Mayank says a number of things.

102
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,790
My question is, how can I get a job as a full stack web developer to my dream company?

103
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,340
What do I have to master to do so?

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,590
Okay.

105
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,990
So your goal is to get a job as full stack web developer.

106
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,070
Now, some of you guys watching, maybe your goal is to get a job as an iOS developer.

107
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,520
Maybe you want to work as a data scientist.

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,960
Maybe you want to work at Facebook, Apple, Google, whatever it may be.

109
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,840
But the great thing is you already got your goal.

110
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,630
Like this is the first step because there are so many people I talked to who don't even know what they

111
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,050
want.

112
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,320
So you're already one step ahead of other people.

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,750
So now that you know what you want to get, how do you get them?

114
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,460
Well, let's think about it from the other point of view.

115
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,250
Let's say that you're a company.

116
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,620
Let's say you're a manager at Google and you want to hire a web developer.

117
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,560
Well, if you were the one who is doing the interview, who is sifting through all of the applications,

118
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,610
what would you think about?

119
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,700
This is a really, really useful exercise.

120
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:07,320
And this is something that I really it took it took some growing up to actually understand this, because

121
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,220
when you think about it from the other person's perspective, you know, they're not trying to make

122
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,210
it hard for you.

123
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,090
They're not trying to make you jump through hoops for the sake of jumping through hoops.

124
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,760
But let's say that you get like 20,000 applications.

125
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,920
So recently we were looking for a summer intern and there's just loads, loads of applications that

126
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,610
come in.

127
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:40,290
And, you know, as much as you really want to give each application all of your attention and just.

128
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,720
You know, really understand each person.

129
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,340
You don't really have the time.

130
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:52,150
So you're going to have to think about ways of making it a bit easier on yourself.

131
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,660
Right?

132
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,300
So one of those ways is by looking at somebody's qualification.

133
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:05,140
But another way, and probably something that I'm more fond of is actually just looking at what are

134
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,390
they capable of doing?

135
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,330
And this really is a key.

136
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:10,900
So.

137
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,170
You need to build a portfolio.

138
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,090
You need to show the world, not tell the world what you can do.

139
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:23,560
So create some web apps.

140
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,450
If you want to become a web developer, create some iOS apps if you want to become an iOS developer.

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,520
And don't just.

142
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,090
Don't just stick to the the stuff that you see in tutorials.

143
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,730
You have to somehow stand out.

144
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:46,620
And one of the best tips I can give you is, again, think from the recruiter's point of view.

145
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,810
They want to hire a web developer.

146
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,980
They are probably a manager, right, of some sort.

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,020
What are the kind of tools that they use every day?

148
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,560
So if you're a manager, especially if you're a product manager or a software lead, you're probably

149
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,210
going to use some form of task management like Trello or Asana.

150
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,130
You're probably going to use GitHub or something like it.

151
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,390
Hub like Bitbucket.

152
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,920
Think about the tools they use and build a tool that they can understand.

153
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,300
So if they use Trello or Asana, I'm sure there's pain points.

154
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,430
I'm sure there are certain features that would be really cool.

155
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:42,390
So if you build a Trello clone, but you add in some features of your own, some something that you

156
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,090
think of that you think would be really useful, and then you show that manager what you've built.

157
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,610
They will instantly understand what you've built.

158
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,560
They will see the advantages of your product, and they will be able to attest to your skill, which

159
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,310
is what is so, so important.

160
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:11,320
So my advice, whenever you want to achieve any sort of goal that involves other people, is to think

161
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,720
from the other person's point of view.

162
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,460
All right.

163
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:27,640
So we've done a couple of questions from the ask page now, and I'm seeing so much chat activity.

164
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,870
I really want to get to know you guys a little bit better.

165
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,600
So I want to do a poll.

166
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,500
So it's going to be pull time.

167
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,710
All right.

168
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:53,370
So if you go ahead and take a look at my slide, I want to know where you are.

169
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,070
So where are you streaming from?

170
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,570
Now, what you need to do is to head over to this link.

171
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:07,560
So wait a minute, I'm going to remove this banner and you can see if you go to London, Apple.com forward

172
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:16,260
slash where it will redirect you to this horribly long URL that's underneath, which is a poll.

173
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:25,200
So choose an answer and I want to know what your location is.

174
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,530
All right.

175
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,470
So I think some of you guys have voted.

176
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,010
Let's see the results.

177
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:35,970
Okay.

178
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,760
I think there's like 200 votes now.

179
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm going to take a look at the results.

180
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,090
All right.

181
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,130
So it seems like most people are from Asia.

182
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,660
Next is Europe and next is North America.

183
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,240
I mean, that kind of makes sense to me.

184
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,750
I think it's about evening time in Asia now and then in Europe where I'm at in London, we're kind of

185
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,350
during the day and then North America is just waking up.

186
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,240
So that's pretty cool.

187
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,500
All right.

188
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,740
So let's take some questions from YouTube.

189
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:19,670
You guys have been chatting away in there and I'm trying to look at it for.

190
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,290
Just to see what's actually happening if you're getting the audio and everything.

191
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,120
But let's take some questions from YouTube.

192
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,000
So go ahead and ask away.

193
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,520
All right.

194
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,700
So we got one here from Claudia, and it's going to cut off because it's quite long, but I'll read

195
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,510
it out to you.

196
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,240
I want to ask you about the way you learn new coding skills.

197
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,900
How do you go about teaching yourself new skills?

198
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,120
What's your learning process?

199
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,260
Okay, cool.

200
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,610
So.

201
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,140
I think one of the most useful skills.

202
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,300
Like that I've ever picked up is learning.

203
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:13,980
I think if you can learn quite quickly, then it's going to help you in pretty much all sorts of ways.

204
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,390
So.

205
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:25,950
One of the ways that I do, one of the ways I sort of conceptualize it is I try to take the entire topic

206
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:32,640
and I break it down into, you know, what are all the parts that I need to learn?

207
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,500
Because when you take a textbook or when you take I don't know, let's say I mean, for example, at

208
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,480
the moment I'm trying to learn German, right?

209
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,690
If I just took a dictionary, it would take me years, years before I will learn it.

210
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:54,240
And I see sometimes people learning programming a bit like that, like they try to learn every single

211
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:03,180
method, every single function in a particular programming languages API or, you know, just, just

212
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,140
trying to learn it.

213
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,859
All right.

214
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:11,190
And there's a lot of courses are also kind of like a reference guide kind of style where they show you

215
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,030
everything.

216
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,650
And I think in terms of learning, it doesn't really work.

217
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,869
Instead, what you kind of need to do is, again, you have to have a goal, right?

218
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:30,150
So if you're learning to program, maybe that goal is you have a particular app you want to build now

219
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,180
the certain foundational skills that you need.

220
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,580
But once you get past the foundation, then you're kind of doing like learning Lego.

221
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,830
You're trying to figure out, Okay, I need to learn this bit.

222
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,060
Where should I go for that?

223
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,520
I need to learn that part in order to do this.

224
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,940
So, for example, the way that I'm thinking about German, like learning German, I've realized I don't

225
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,050
need to write German.

226
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,910
I probably could read, but it doesn't really bother me.

227
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,240
All I want to focus on is actually listening and speaking, so that already makes my task a lot easier.

228
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:16,740
Now next, if I want to be able to speak well, then I have to practice, right?

229
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:26,190
So there's a really good course actually by Pimsleur that I use where all they do is they just teach

230
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,740
you a couple of ways of saying a sentence and then they get you to practice.

231
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,210
You just, you know, they'll be like, what is how do you say, I want to go to the restaurant?

232
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,070
How do you say I'm going to the restaurant?

233
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,680
How do you say I went to the restaurant, etc.?

234
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,540
And you have a lot of practice just putting the words together in some sort of logical way.

235
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:55,140
And then because it's not really interactive, it's just, you know, a list of sentences, I have to

236
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,880
say.

237
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:04,230
Then I will take that and take Google Translate, which can listen live to what you're speaking in German,

238
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:10,170
and I'll translate it to English text so then I can judge based on that translation.

239
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,970
Well, how good is my German?

240
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,570
Did I manage to conjugate my verbs correctly?

241
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,430
Did I manage to put everything together?

242
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:27,420
And then in terms of listening, one of the hacks that I kind of came up with, I guess, I'm sure it's

243
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:34,440
not original, but I watched a lot of shows on Netflix, as I'm sure a lot of you guys do.

244
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:43,290
But I discovered that if you listen to a TV show that's produced in another language, so for me it's

245
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,010
German.

246
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,730
You can switch on not only the subtitles, which is helpful, but you can switch on something called

247
00:19:50,730 --> 00:20:03,630
audio described, which basically will describe to you it's intended for people who are unable to see,

248
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,440
to be able to hear what's happening in the show.

249
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,260
But to somebody who's also, you know, not really very good at the language hearing what's happening

250
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,380
on the screen being described to me in German, you know, it will be something like a man walks into

251
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,800
the room, the man takes the keys from the table.

252
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,820
Like, I can see that.

253
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,760
I can see what's happening and I can match up what's happening with what's being described.

254
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,330
And this has been really, really helpful for me to learn listening.

255
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:40,200
So yeah, basically what I would say is break down the problem, figure out the goal, just take the

256
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:48,390
parts that you need to do to achieve the goal and then see how you can practice those skills repeatedly.

257
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,240
That's that's probably the best way of learning.

258
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,200
All right.

259
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,680
Let's take another question from YouTube.

260
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,410
All right.

261
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,320
We got one from.

262
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:15,820
I think your name is Yuvraj Agarkar car, so it's going to cut off the text again, but I'll read it

263
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,210
out.

264
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,470
I'm 17 and I've completed your iOS and Web dev courses.

265
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,230
My question is how to be good at reading docs and also how to start a startup.

266
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:26,800
Okay, cool.

267
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
So there's two questions in there.

268
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,000
First question is how do you get good at reading docs?

269
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:36,230
The answer is it depends.

270
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:42,280
So firstly, there's a difference in the quality of documentation.

271
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:53,110
So I worked a lot with iOS, and so I'm mostly reading Apple documentation, which is I mean, it's

272
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,830
beautiful.

273
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,500
Like they've laid out the website really nicely, but if you've taken my eyes courses, you know that

274
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,510
I think they're kind of minimalist.

275
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,560
They're kind of just like, Oh yeah, we have this thing which you can use, but why don't you go and

276
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,240
like find out yourself how to do it?

277
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,610
So yeah, it's useful.

278
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:18,220
But you know, if you've ever looked at some of Google's documentation, especially flutter documentation

279
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,030
is absolutely incredible and.

280
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,260
You know, really like kudos to the team because it is the best documentation I have ever seen.

281
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,560
It's kind of like this is a method that we have in this particular module.

282
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,970
This is how you would use it.

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,500
Here's a code example.

284
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:45,170
Here are the various parameters that you can tweak, and it is just so good that you can sort of imagine

285
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:48,110
yourself being able to pick up how to use it very easily.

286
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,980
Whereas Apple kind of like, Yeah, we don't really care.

287
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,670
You know, if you make it, you make it.

288
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,340
If you make an app, there's enough people who make apps.

289
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,790
I don't know.

290
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,180
I don't know.

291
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,960
What is that?

292
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,210
They're thinking behind that documentation.

293
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,310
But it's it's very hard.

294
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,360
The second thing I would say is that you don't necessarily learn a lot from documentation.

295
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:14,570
It's kind of like if you were learning a language and your starting point was the dictionary, you'll

296
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,830
be there for a while.

297
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:23,240
So the good thing is that, you know, this kind of comes back to how you learn, right?

298
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:31,250
A lot of people still learn in a pre-computer, pre-internet kind of way where you read a book, you

299
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,670
your lecturer gives you a lecture.

300
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,110
You take notes, you memorize those notes, you read the book, you take more notes.

301
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,100
You do a test.

302
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,100
This, I would say.

303
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,530
Is good for exams or for school.

304
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,330
It's probably still the way you have to do it.

305
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:54,030
But if you actually just trying to learn a skill for life or for, you know, changing jobs or just

306
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,610
for yourself, it's not the best way because information is really cheap.

307
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:06,660
You can get hold of pretty much any knowledge or information you want just by typing it into Google.

308
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:15,000
So why should I store all of that information in my brain when you know it's just two or three keystrokes

309
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,540
away?

310
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,550
So I don't really like to do that.

311
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,620
And this comes back to documentation.

312
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,810
I don't remember documentation.

313
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,640
I don't learn documentation.

314
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:31,770
There are loads of methods that I'm not, you know, I don't remember how to use.

315
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:41,100
But the thing I know is that I have the skills to be able to understand the code when I need to.

316
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,660
So when I want to look something up, I look it up in the documentation.

317
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,820
Actually, usually I look it up in StackOverflow.

318
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:54,360
I try to see an example where it's used and then in the example I'll see a particular method that's

319
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,190
in the documentation.

320
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,070
And then if I want more background, I'll read up on it.

321
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:05,460
In the documentation it's much better to learn things as and when you need to.

322
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,000
So that's pretty much what I do.

323
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,410
So the next question is how to start a startup.

324
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,190
That's like a really big question.

325
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:30,360
And I think back in the ask, there's also somebody who asked, I think it was somebody called Oliver

326
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,840
who said, What do you recommend to aspiring entrepreneurs?

327
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,000
So I'm going to answer these two together.

328
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,650
So.

329
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,520
When I started.

330
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:52,900
So I kind of started building a startup while I was still working as a doctor, which is probably a

331
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:02,830
little bit masochistic because I was working these crazy hours like, Oh man, it was probably like

332
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,090
some 14 hour occasionally, like 16 hour days.

333
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:15,530
And but the good thing about medicine, at least, is you have night shifts or the good thing or the

334
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:23,660
bad thing and the night shifts, you know, to be humane, at least in Europe, after three days of

335
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,940
night shifts, we tend to get three days off.

336
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:32,360
So the first day you'll be completely destroyed, you'll be hardly human because you're trying to switch

337
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,230
time zones, right?

338
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,500
It's kind of like flying to Australia and back every week.

339
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:44,840
So the first day is kind of like gone, but the second and third days I found that I was able to kind

340
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:52,460
of recuperate those days and I would just go to the library and I would work on my startup.

341
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,800
So the first thing is you got to find time.

342
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,040
There is no perfect time to start a startup.

343
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:03,740
There is no perfect opportunity.

344
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,660
That's just going to hit you on the head.

345
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:14,120
Everything that we've built, everything every opportunity that's come to us has taken a lot of work

346
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,250
to prepare to get to that point.

347
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,760
Right.

348
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,930
I think there was this this thing that my granddad drilled into me, which is my late granddad.

349
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,740
He he used to take me to school on his bicycle every day.

350
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:34,640
And on this little, like 30 minute bicycle ride, he would give me these, like, um, chicken soup

351
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,660
style, like pieces of, like, nuggets of advice.

352
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,410
I was like so many pieces of advice, including, like, they're going to sound weird.

353
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:54,800
It's like, if you ate beans uncooked twice and you still continue eating uncooked beans, then that's

354
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,790
not very smart.

355
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,810
So I think what he's trying to say is, don't make the same mistake twice.

356
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,290
I don't know why it has to do with uncooked beans.

357
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:15,350
But another thing that he told me is that, you know, opportunities come to those who are prepared.

358
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,670
I'm pretty sure it was another food analogy because I do really well with food analogies.

359
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,590
That's the way I understand the world.

360
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,760
But he says that, you know.

361
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:34,210
Every time you see somebody looking like as if they were just an overnight success, it's never overnight.

362
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:44,170
You don't see all the hours and days that they've poured into doing something fruitful or not successful

363
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,710
or not until they get to the point where they're prepared enough to be hit by that opportunity.

364
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,830
So a good example, I think is, for example, we built the flutter course because.

365
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:06,200
Tim, who heads up the Flutter team at Google, took my iOS course and he loved it so much that he reached

366
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:13,430
out to me over Twitter and this is how we partnered with the Flutter team at Google to build this course

367
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,150
together.

368
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:22,320
Now, if I had just started building courses day one and, you know, firstly nobody would know about

369
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,620
you.

370
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,500
Secondly, you know, there's no track record.

371
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,520
And thirdly, I'm not even sure I would be able to build such a good course from scratch.

372
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
So.

373
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,780
You know, the idea is to spend all of your time preparing, your start up, working on it, and then,

374
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,010
you know, there will be moments, there will be wins and there'll be losses and you have to grab onto

375
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,800
the wins and not think too much about the losses.

376
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,070
That's pretty much in a nutshell how I think about.

377
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,060
Our startup.

378
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,750
Okay.

379
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:05,290
So I'm going to go back to the chat and I'm going to ask you guys for some more questions and let's

380
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,180
see if we got some good ones.

381
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,260
All right.

382
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,150
So I think when I was looking at the questions that people had asked previously and also in YouTube

383
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,810
right now, the one that I'm seeing a lot is this one.

384
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:29,120
It seems like everybody wants to know when the iOS 14 update is coming for iOS, or is there going to

385
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,290
be a new course?

386
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,730
When is it going to happen?

387
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,960
What is happening on that?

388
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,440
Should I wait for the course?

389
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,550
Should I continue the iOS 13 course?

390
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,050
What's happening?

391
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,230
Okay, so here's what is happening.

392
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:52,580
We've reviewed Big Sur and also the latest version of Xcode.

393
00:30:52,610 --> 00:31:00,140
We're in the process of testing the course through all of these new pieces of software, and what we

394
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,620
realized is that the changes are not that great.

395
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,080
So there's basically not enough changes to.

396
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:16,220
They tweaked the style of Xcode a little bit and they've added some handy features, which we might

397
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,880
point out.

398
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:24,200
But essentially over, you know, what we've been doing is we've, we've been just sort of trying to

399
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,300
figure out how we can update the last parts of the course because they're more outdated.

400
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,340
Whereas the beginning modules sort of up to flash chat, I think.

401
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,190
So the first 14 or 15 modules we're going to keep as is because they still work, but we'll update some

402
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,180
of the interfaces.

403
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:49,250
So at least initially it won't be so confusing, but that means that there will be no new iOS course.

404
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:54,610
You won't have to buy anything or the updates that we're making through this winter.

405
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,060
Next spring will get added to the existing iOS course.

406
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,000
So don't buy any more courses.

407
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,250
Just keep the one that you already have and you'll see the updates roll in.

408
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:12,980
But if you're already learning with the course, don't worry, the changes are not that big.

409
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,100
You'll be able to you'll be able to figure it out.

410
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,470
So that's that's what's happening on that.

411
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,790
And let's see what other questions we've got in YouTube.

412
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,370
All right.

413
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:39,320
So we've got a question from Atharva Vasco and also some people on YouTube, it seems.

414
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,420
Do you watch anime?

415
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,380
Okay.

416
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,350
So that's.

417
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,300
Kind of.

418
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,280
It's interesting.

419
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,800
That's that's a question that everybody wants to know.

420
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,060
I wonder if it's because of all the memes I've put into the courses from anime.

421
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,670
So I.

422
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,660
I don't think that.

423
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,580
So the anime that I like basically is quite old school.

424
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,110
You know, your girl's not young.

425
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:21,970
And so, for example, Ghibli movies Spirited Away, it's like one of my favorite all time movies.

426
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,080
It I love it so much, but pretty much any Djibouti movie, it's it's amazing.

427
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,910
It's just like paints the scene.

428
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:36,920
But more recently, I'm kind of late to the bandwagon here, but Netflix started showing this sort of

429
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,140
a Western anime called Avatar The Last Airbender.

430
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:49,220
So if you haven't watched this, don't be put off by the name.

431
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,810
It has a horrible name, but it is so good.

432
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:01,280
It it's like reliving childhood, you know, like, if you could just go back to being a little child,

433
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,180
that's how it feels.

434
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:07,040
It's so wholesome and oh, my God, it's just so good.

435
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,830
If you haven't watch it, I wouldn't ruin it for you.

436
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:18,590
But it is literally the best animated show I have ever watched, and it has a special place in my heart.

437
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:22,250
Okay, what other questions have we got?

438
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,320
We've got a question from a 13 year old boy.

439
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,090
I think I've had hoots about hoots about dudes.

440
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:36,770
I'm not sure.

441
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:43,010
And he asked, What careers can I have at age 13?

442
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,739
Okay, so the full question I will read out because it's a little bit long.

443
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:54,909
He says that I'm a 13 year old boy.

444
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,820
I'm doing your web development course.

445
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm even doing a course based on how to create A.I. and ethical hacking.

446
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,880
What careers can I have at this age or job that doesn't consider my age?

447
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,330
Please take this question.

448
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,220
Love the way you teach.

449
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,900
Found it easy to understand Avatar.

450
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,880
Okay, so firstly, why are you thinking about work?

451
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,200
You're 13 men.

452
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,250
Like, just enjoy life.

453
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,940
It's so good to be that age.

454
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:31,690
But then again, I have to say, like when I was when I was 13, I was probably the same as you.

455
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:36,460
I was also thinking about, like, how to get a job.

456
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,420
I don't know what it is.

457
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,800
I think you're probably an overachiever, like a type a person like me as well.

458
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,110
So.

459
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:53,400
When I was 13, I was thinking that I'd really like to have some pocket money because my parents didn't

460
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,620
really believe in pocket money and there were like sweets and snacks that my friends were having and

461
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,430
I was kind of jealous.

462
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,210
So I was like, You know what?

463
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm going to make my own money.

464
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,680
So I decided to take an inventory of What am I good at?

465
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,800
And I tried out a couple of things.

466
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,880
One is I got legs I can walk.

467
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,870
So I signed up for this thing in the UK.

468
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,560
I'm not even sure what it's called and elsewhere, but basically there's this giant book, like a telephone

469
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,500
directory that we used to have, like pre-internet days.

470
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,990
It's called like the Yellow Pages in the UK, and you can basically go door to door lugging these like

471
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,970
two kilogram books and you get paid a pound.

472
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:41,400
So like about $1.20 for every one of these books that you deliver.

473
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:49,020
So the thing is that there's so heavy that like, I don't know that they're like two kilos each.

474
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:57,900
So if you imagine in ten of them and I was 13, that was pretty hard and I got some pocket money, but

475
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,910
I thought about iterating on that.

476
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,100
So, you know, coming back to startups, you've got to try something, you test it out, see if it

477
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,720
works, if people like it.

478
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,920
So if it gets you to your goal and if not you iterate.

479
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,450
So my iteration basically ended up in me thinking about what else do I have?

480
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:22,800
And maybe like manual labor isn't really my strong point.

481
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:29,820
So I thought that, well, you know, I'm like pretty good at maths, I'm pretty good at physics and

482
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,360
there's probably other kids who want to learn maths and physics.

483
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:39,060
So I printed out these little flyers like from my little home printer.

484
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:43,380
So like they were like this big each per add because I didn't want to waste too much ink.

485
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:49,560
And I cut it out of the page and it's about like eight ads per page.

486
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:55,740
And I went door to door around sort of my neighbourhood area, like an area that I thought was like

487
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,210
within walking distance.

488
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:04,260
And I posted it to everybody in the mailbox and then like some people actually called me up and then

489
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:10,410
I became a tutor, although probably illegally, because I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to work

490
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,150
and earn money at age 13 unless you're like supervised or something.

491
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,560
But that was like my first entrepreneurial bent.

492
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,790
So coming back to your question, what careers can you have at age 13?

493
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,850
Well, now that you have the Internet effectively, you could do anything you could like probably sign

494
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:34,380
up on Fiverr and start doing freelance gigs.

495
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,190
I think when people sign up to these freelance gigs, they always want to like charge what it's worth.

496
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:47,670
And I would say, just don't do that, don't, don't like go overboard charge way, way below what you

497
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,170
think it should cost.

498
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:55,380
So you want to build somebody a website, charge $5 for it, you know, and what you want to do is like

499
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:03,120
build up your reputation so as you get more clients and if they like what you do, hopefully you're

500
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,310
doing a good job because you know, you're my student, right?

501
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,960
So you're going to be pretty good.

502
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,230
And when you give the project back to them, you're learning like skills, like communication, how

503
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:18,150
to work with clients, what clients mean when they're saying like, Oh, I would like that to look more

504
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,870
classy.

505
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,910
What does that actually mean to a web developer?

506
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,320
Well, you're going to work that out.

507
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,330
So once you've got a good client, then you've got a word of mouth.

508
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,710
You've also got reviews.

509
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,690
You've got a client who can be your referee and you build up on that.

510
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,650
So you take on more clients, maybe you've got too much work.

511
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,990
So now you raise your you raise your price now $10, and then you've got like too much work again.

512
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,670
You raise your price to $20.

513
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,130
And that way eventually you'll get to the point where you're making enough pocket money to buy sweets

514
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,940
or whatever it is you know, you want to achieve.

515
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,250
Maybe you want to like buy stocks at age 13, maybe you're going to buy into Tesla.

516
00:39:59,250 --> 00:39:59,970
I don't know.

517
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,420
But yeah, so that's that's my advice.

518
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:11,310
Let's see if we got some more questions on YouTube.

519
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,440
So.

520
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,490
Let's see what you guys are saying in here.

521
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,860
Oh, this is a really good one.

522
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,560
So this is a question from Dionysius.

523
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,760
Dionysius.

524
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,410
I think that's how you pronounce it.

525
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,500
And he asked, Understanding syntax is not so difficult.

526
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:46,180
Formulating syntax together with logic to build functional code is difficult.

527
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,750
What are the best strategies to connect the dots to build real world projects?

528
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:56,410
This is something that you guys upvoted a lot and it's something that we think is really important because

529
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,630
one of the sort of feedback that we always getting from students is, Yeah, okay, so like, you know,

530
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:09,700
I've completed this tutorial, I've completed that tutorial, but you know, after I'm done, I still

531
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,580
don't know how to make my project.

532
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,880
I still don't know like how to, how to build something, right?

533
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:23,770
So this was really like our thinking when we started building the 100 Days of Code Project.

534
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:33,850
I wanted to make a course basically, which starts out with tutorials and a lot of heavy sort of guidance.

535
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:44,650
But then to progress on to be able to let you experience what it's like when the training wheels are

536
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:45,250
off.

537
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:52,210
So when I first learned how to ride a bicycle, I was riding it and I didn't really have one of those

538
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,160
fancy bicycles with the training wheels.

539
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,240
I just had my dad, like, holding the bicycle from behind.

540
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,590
And, you know, initially I was just riding.

541
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,820
He was running behind.

542
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,280
And at some point he kind of let go.

543
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,060
And I didn't really notice and I could just start cycling myself.

544
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,960
But then when I turned around and I saw that there was nobody there, I immediately crashed.

545
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,470
Right.

546
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,690
So, yeah, I guess my, my track record with bicycles is not great.

547
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:26,740
But so I guess the learning point there is that, you know.

548
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:36,370
You can't always be in territorial land if you want to become somebody who's not dependent on tutorials.

549
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:44,830
So a lot of people have been asking me, hey, you know, this course hundred days of code, why is

550
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,040
it that there's like less and less video towards the end?

551
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,290
Is it because you haven't finished it?

552
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,190
What's happening?

553
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,820
So the answer to that is, no, it's not because I haven't finished it.

554
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,050
It's because it's really carefully thought out, believe it or not.

555
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,990
And the idea is to.

556
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:12,640
Be that person holding the bicycle from behind and then to eventually let you go, because I want you

557
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:20,020
to be able to finish that course and to get a job or to build your own start up, build your own project.

558
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:22,810
But that requires quite a bit of struggle.

559
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,440
And the struggle comes from building projects.

560
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,040
Right.

561
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,900
But, you know, when I say to people, the best way to learn to code after you finish your tutorial

562
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,730
is to build a project.

563
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,360
Will they say, I don't know, which project do I build and how do I build it?

564
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,620
I don't know how to get there.

565
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:47,050
So that's why we built this course, to try and make it so that initially you have sort of more step

566
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:55,270
by step, like video lessons, and then you have step by step text lessons with more dependence on the

567
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:01,930
documentation and on the kind of real tools that a developer would use like Google and StackOverflow.

568
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,070
You need to struggle.

569
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,980
You need to find out the answers for yourself.

570
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,040
But, you know, there's walkthroughs and there's guidance.

571
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,830
And then eventually to get you to the very end where you're actually building your own projects for

572
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:20,830
your own portfolio, which contains 100% your own code, which you can copy, right?

573
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,620
You can sell, you can do whatever you want because it's your own.

574
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:29,920
And what we've done is just provided the project ideas for you, something that we think is really feasible

575
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,810
that you can definitely do if you've completed the entire first 80 days.

576
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,360
So that was what we tried to do.

577
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:46,360
And, you know, I think the best way to build real world projects is to start small.

578
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,970
So don't start off trying to build a car, build a skateboard instead.

579
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:58,060
And then once you've built the skateboard, maybe add a handle to it, turn it into a scooter, and

580
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,720
then maybe once you've done that, turn it into a motorcycle and then turn it into a car.

581
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:07,990
Don't just go out there and be like, I want to build Facebook plus Twitter plus, you know, whatever

582
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:12,010
enterprise software and I'm going to do it like after I complete this course.

583
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,320
Like, that's just you're setting yourself up to fail.

584
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,810
You have to start with something simple.

585
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,200
All right, so what kind of running?

586
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,920
A bit over?

587
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,430
I said we'd do 45 minutes, but we're kind of close to an hour now, so I'm just going to glance at

588
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:32,740
the YouTube chat and try to see what you guys are saying, like live.

589
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,910
Let's do some quick questions, swift UI or UI kit.

590
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,060
So if UI is getting a lot better.

591
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:47,920
But you know, when we did the Swift the Objective-C to Swift conversion, it took like years.

592
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,200
Still like loads of apps are built with Objective-C.

593
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,330
So Swift UI is not something that you can learn and get hired for right now.

594
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,350
It's really fun and I really enjoy playing with it, but.

595
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,860
I don't really think it's serious enough, like for my needs at the moment.

596
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,000
So we're probably going to build in more tutorials to the existing course.

597
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,910
So if you miss that, you don't have to buy a new course.

598
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:20,920
Your existing iOS 13 course will get updated, but it's going to be probably more swift UI, a little

599
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:28,240
bit less uikit and then we're going to keep tweaking that percentage until, you know, until like when

600
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,740
Apple fully transitions.

601
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,050
But I want to do it slowly because right now the kind of skills that's really important that's going

602
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,670
to get you hired is uikit.

603
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,610
Can you make your iOS course like 100 days challenge code?

604
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,390
I think we thought about making the 100 days of code challenge.

605
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,480
We thought about like, what's the perfect language for it?

606
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:58,730
Because Python is something that you can do, like a lot of different things with like web development

607
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:03,290
or data science or scripting or automation.

608
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:12,320
Swift is pretty much all about making apps, and it just doesn't really work that well with it.

609
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,250
I think it works better when you can actually build real projects, like big projects that you can show

610
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,640
off and you can use.

611
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,090
I think it's just a better format.

612
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,840
Like none of the things that we do is random.

613
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:29,540
Like I spend a lot of time thinking about it.

614
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:32,240
Okay.

615
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,410
What kind of games do you prefer?

616
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,930
Computer slash android.

617
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,150
Oh, man.

618
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,430
I recently got into this steam game called Salt and Sanctuary.

619
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,600
It's a two player couch co-op, and it's just so good.

620
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:56,250
It's like it's got, like, the RPG elements, it's got platforming, it's got some combat, and it's

621
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,290
got, like, just a lot of elements.

622
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,610
It's like, really well-rounded.

623
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:04,920
And I discovered that it was actually made by like, one guy, essentially, he built the entire video

624
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,390
game, which is crazy.

625
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,350
It's a really good one.

626
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,990
And on Android, on phone.

627
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,630
Yeah, among us, it's a bit of a guilty pleasure if you haven't played it.

628
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,430
Don't don't start.

629
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,640
Okay, so what else are we seeing in the chat?

630
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,100
Will you intend to build a Java course?

631
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,960
Probably not.

632
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,460
I don't really like Java that much.

633
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:37,830
I feel like Oracle is going to like send me a lawsuit just for saying the word Java.

634
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:44,700
So the funny story is that we obviously have like an Android course and Android courses built with Java.

635
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,540
So we thought it'd be a good idea to put the Java logo on the course image.

636
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:55,350
And then we got this like really serious letter from Oracle saying, Yeah, you're going to take off

637
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,350
our logo because you don't own the logo for Java.

638
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:03,000
And we were like, Hey, man, we're trying to teach your technology to people.

639
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,210
Like, we're trying to teach more people Java, which you own, but they were like, Nope.

640
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:12,630
So yeah, I think they're bit they're a bit old on that front.

641
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,860
Let's see, what other messages have you guys got?

642
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,700
I'm completing 100 days of code course with my grandfather.

643
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,720
Wow.

644
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,170
That's amazing.

645
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:31,590
I've heard of people completing it with, like, their kids, like the ten year old or 11 year old kids.

646
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,450
But that's pretty awesome.

647
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,690
You know, this is another good point.

648
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:43,410
My friend was recently telling me the story that they so he works at a bank and he was saying how they

649
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:52,110
have this guy who is like the godfather of like their platform's code and nobody else can like fix it

650
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:53,190
other than him.

651
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:57,240
And I was like really curious, you know?

652
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:05,400
And so one day the like, grandmaster of the finance company's code comes in and he's got like a walking

653
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:05,670
stick.

654
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,780
He's like 69 or something, and he's like really old.

655
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,250
He's got like white heads.

656
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:20,850
And it turns out that their entire system is built on pretty much like, you know, like really, really

657
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,170
old tech, right?

658
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:29,250
And this is like the only guy who really understands how to do it, these kind of old programming languages

659
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:35,250
like COBOL or Fortran, you know, because there's not actually a lot of people who know it and it's

660
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,210
super hard.

661
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,130
Like if you tried learning.

662
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,620
C And you think that's hard like try learning Fortran, it's it's even harder.

663
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:49,590
I guess there's also a machine code, but you know, there's also a point to be made that maybe somebody

664
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:54,900
should teach like these old languages because there's obviously some future in it as well.

665
00:50:54,990 --> 00:51:00,330
Like all of the airline industry banking, they're all built on COBOL, which is crazy.

666
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,250
What are the best books that you've read this year?

667
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,200
The best books.

668
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:17,430
Oh, there's a really good book on negotiation by Chris Voss, and he's like this ex FBI negotiator,

669
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,070
so like negotiating hostage releases and everything.

670
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:25,960
And he wrote this book called Oh, man, what's it called?

671
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,040
Something about like.

672
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,770
Never split the difference.

673
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,400
That's it.

674
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,790
So he basically just teaches you like how to negotiate, like if you want to buy a used car, how to

675
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,860
get the best deal.

676
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:44,960
But using all of these skills that he got from like the FBI, which is absolutely insane.

677
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,340
It was a really good book.

678
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,670
Okay, so what else have we got?

679
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:55,120
Java, C++, or Python, which is the most powerful.

680
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,780
I mean, what?

681
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,250
What are you trying to like?

682
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,170
You like street fighters.

683
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:03,540
You know how on YouTube there's all these, like, videos of, like, bear?

684
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,690
This is Cobra.

685
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,680
I think somebody should make a YouTube video where it's like Java programmer versus Python program.

686
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:13,480
I don't know.

687
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,480
I don't think any of them are more powerful.

688
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,220
I think they have their own uses.

689
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:22,030
It's like kind of saying, you know, hammer versus sor who's going to win.

690
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:25,030
Doesn't really make too much sense.

691
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,190
What have we got?

692
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:35,950
Web development or software development, which one do you prefer?

693
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,360
Ooh, that's a really hard one.

694
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,120
I like.

695
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,770
I like both, actually.

696
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,580
I don't know.

697
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,010
I don't have a strong feeling towards it.

698
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,980
I mean, okay.

699
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,030
So he's a bit of a a secret.

700
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,090
I don't really like JavaScript that much.

701
00:52:53,750 --> 00:53:00,410
I think if you're somebody who's played with a lot of the newer languages that have been like developed

702
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:05,420
recently rather than a language that's all that's just had new things bolted on, like JavaScript.

703
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,340
You realize like how nice it is.

704
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,250
Like Swift is lovely, Kotlin is nice.

705
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:19,310
Dart like they're all really nice languages, python but JavaScript but web development you can do with

706
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,660
Python with JavaScript.

707
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,690
That's really your choice these days with so many frameworks.

708
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,140
What else have we got?

709
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,960
Can you say something about UI UX designing?

710
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,710
UI UX designing.

711
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,620
It's really important.

712
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,140
Oh, this is a good tip.

713
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,780
Don't think about you on UX at the end.

714
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,640
A friend of mine is a UX designer and she's really, really good.

715
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,680
But like she says, always what happens is like, companies will bring her in at the very end.

716
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,020
They're like, Oh, to sprinkle you like UX magic dust.

717
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,210
And it's like, No, that doesn't work.

718
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,440
You have to start from the very beginning.

719
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,230
So super important.

720
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:06,590
Like read more about it.

721
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,640
Try out loads of apps.

722
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,190
I know that these days people kind of like just have seven apps on their phone and they don't really

723
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,450
add any other ones.

724
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:21,650
But try out apps, try out that user experience, and then just make a note of the ones that you really

725
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,220
like.

726
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:30,290
Like recently in the UK, there's a bank startup called Monzo, and when you get their bank card in

727
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:33,170
the mail, when you're setting it up.

728
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,390
So when you're doing that with like a normal bank, like HSBC or whatever, you have to like call up

729
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,040
the customer service.

730
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,270
You have to go into the branch, they type some stuff, you fill in some forms.

731
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,130
This Monzo card came in.

732
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:52,850
I had to download the Monzo app and then it was literally like using NFC touch to a phone, and then

733
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,260
it was like, it's all set up.

734
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,210
That was amazing.

735
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,110
That is good UX.

736
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,820
That is some fantastic us.

737
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:09,960
Last question I'm going to take I'm going to pick the last question before we take off.

738
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,280
Let's see,

739
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,720
what's the last question?

740
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,110
Oh, so hard.

741
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,140
La la, la.

742
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:27,580
Okay.

743
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,420
I'm going to pick you because I see you in the Q&A doing 100 days of Python all the time.

744
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,820
Matea, you're like really, really strong on the motivation.

745
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,530
So your question is, how do you make prices for software?

746
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,210
Like how do you price software?

747
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,770
I think is what you mean.

748
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:53,450
I mean, theoretically, what people say is price your software at the price that people are willing

749
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,380
to pay for it.

750
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:03,530
But I mean, I'm not really the right person to ask because I don't really like doing marketing or really

751
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,670
like doing sales.

752
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,150
I just don't like when I make my courses.

753
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,290
I kind of think if it's something that people want, then they'll get it.

754
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,280
Like, I don't want to like.

755
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,200
I don't want to, like, tell people to buy something that they don't need or they don't want.

756
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:28,800
You know, like I think the marketing team wanted me to do this AMA so that we could promote the new

757
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,210
100 days of Python course.

758
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:34,140
But they're going to hate me because I haven't done any of that, and I'm not planning to.

759
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,450
Yeah, I mean, check it out.

760
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:37,920
It's in the description below.

761
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:44,820
If you want to get the 100 days of Python course, you can get it for whatever price is there.

762
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:45,840
But.

763
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:53,520
You know, I think you should price your product depending on its appeal.

764
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,030
So if it's something that has mass appeal, then, you know, you can afford to make it a bit cheaper

765
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:04,340
if it's something that has only very few people interested in it.

766
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:11,070
Like, for example, if tomorrow I wanted to build a software for people who are livestreaming on YouTube

767
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:15,510
so that they can play music as a DJ.

768
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,520
Like I don't know how many people are interested in it.

769
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,390
Maybe a lot actually.

770
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:19,020
I don't know.

771
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,880
But if it's something that's really niche, then you've got to price it more because you know, considering

772
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,920
the amount of time that it takes to develop.

773
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:37,080
But I mean, a good example is that our team thought really hard about how we price our courses.

774
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:42,870
And one of the things that we thought about is that.

775
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:51,120
You know, if we can afford to make it cheaper than we will, because, yes, people will buy it for

776
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,080
$200.

777
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,270
And yes, you know, six people worked on this project for almost two years.

778
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:02,870
And they, you know, they should bring out a product that's worth a lot.

779
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:11,280
But at the same time, you know, like a lot of people around the world have very different living conditions.

780
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,600
I know that I lived in Malawi for a while in Africa.

781
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:22,290
And, you know, I know like in villages and, you know, people don't have a lot.

782
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,750
So what you might think is a lot is what you might think is a little is actually a lot to some other

783
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,050
people.

784
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:33,660
So we really wanted to be able to make choices that anybody can afford.

785
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,390
So I would just say, you know, really depends depends on you.

786
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:48,270
So I think this is going to be the last question, unless there's something fun in here.

787
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,210
Can I work at Upper Income Day?

788
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,880
Well, I mean, there's COVID, but there's also like remote positions.

789
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,510
We're thinking of maybe hiring some interns at some point.

790
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,510
But I don't really know how it'll work.

791
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:07,310
Maybe we'll announce it as, like, an educational announcement.

792
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,990
I don't know, but we'll think about that.

793
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:10,770
All right.

794
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:17,040
So it's now way, way past time and my tummies kind of rumbling.

795
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,510
You know how it is.

796
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:25,890
The girl is hungry, so I'm going to probably sign off and.

797
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,660
So thanks, you guys.

798
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,810
All 1000 of you guys or more who joined in for the live stream today.

799
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:45,330
And I hope you will carry on coding and I hope you all the success in the world from your instructor,

800
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,320
Angela.

801
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,220
Good night.

802
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,120
Good morning.

803
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,350
Wherever you are.

804
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:51,220
By.
