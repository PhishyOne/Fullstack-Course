Hi guys.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:07,550
In this lesson I want to quickly talk through how to get hold of the course resources As you're working

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,730
through the course.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:16,219
In many sections of the course, there will be downloadable resources and they are usually in a compressed

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,940
format.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,750
So you'll see the.zip as the file extension.

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,640
Now what this means is that you can't use the files in this folder as it is.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,340
You have to extract the files out of this folder and then once you've extracted it, you'll see that

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:38,570
the folder contains many resources such as images, or sounds, or other things that we're going to use

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,270
in the project, but also code files, which we're going to be using in order to complete some of the

11
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,160
exercises and projects.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,490
So in order to download the course resources for a particular lesson, I want you to go into the resources

13
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:00,080
for that lesson, which should show up with a folder icon, click the down button and you'll see all

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,450
of the links that are included in that folder.

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,950
And in most cases the download will be a zip file.

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,190
So what I want you to do is to click on it and download should start automatically in your browser.

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,280
And then I want you to head over to your downloads folder,

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,360
and if you're on a Mac computer, then you can simply double-click on the zip file and it will automatically

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,630
extract all of the contents into a new folder.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,120
Now on Windows, it's a little bit different.

21
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:37,230
All you have to do is to select the compressed file in your downloads folder and then you should see

22
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,560
at the top this extract all button show up.

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,830
If you don't see that, then simply just right click on the compressed folder and you should also be able

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:54,750
to find that extract all and then go ahead and simply select, extract and make a note of the destination.

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,060
Now once you've done that and you've gotten hold of the extracted folder and all of the files that it

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,410
contains, then I want you to simply drag it into your Visual Studio code and you'll see that VS Code

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:14,010
will automatically open up your folder and give you access to all of the included files.

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,920
If you try to drag a compressed folder into VS Code, it won't work properly and sometimes you might

29
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,390
be able to see the files, but you might not be able to work with it.

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,130
For example, on Windows you might be able to view the files, but it can create a lot of problems for

31
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,270
you down the road.

32
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:40,080
So remember, whenever you're downloading a file that has the.zip extension, be sure to extract the

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,320
files before you work with it in VS Code.
