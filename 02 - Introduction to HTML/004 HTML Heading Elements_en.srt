1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,130
Now, in the previous lesson, we took a look at what HTML is, and in this lesson, I want to get us started

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:13,640
using HTML as quickly as possible so we can learn how to write our own code and start creating websites

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,240
with it.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,400
Now, in this lesson, we're going to be learning about one of the most important elements, the heading

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,060
element.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,320
And this is what a heading element looks like.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:31,460
It starts off with what's called an opening tag here, and it ends with what's called a closing tag.

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,610
Now, if you look closely, the opening and the closing tag actually have one thing that's different,

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,520
and it's this forward slash right here.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,240
And that is what makes this a closing tag.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:52,100
And what goes in between these two tags is the content of that particular HTML element.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,820
So in this case, what we're saying we want to do is we want to create a h1 heading and what the heading

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,200
is going to contain is these words, "Hello World."

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:10,670
Now, very often when you hear me talking about HTML, you'll hear me refer to tags and elements and

15
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,490
you'll see this on the Internet and everywhere else as well.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,550
So what exactly is the difference?

17
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,360
Well, the tag refers to these bits.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,530
These are tags.

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,530
Anything that's inside an angle bracket, we call these, "angle brackets," is a tag.

20
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,910
And they have different names.

21
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,180
So as I mentioned, this one is the opening tag,

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,950
and this one at the end, is of course called the closing tag.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,920
Now, these are the tags.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,630
So what's an element?

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:52,260
Well, the entire thing here, this is an element. That includes the content as well as any opening or

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,420
closing tags.

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,160
This is the HTML element,

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,550
and these parts are the tags.

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,520
So hopefully that'll make things a little bit clearer the next time you hear about tags and elements.

30
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,750
What is the purpose of these heading elements?

31
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,930
Well, the idea comes from book binding.

32
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,810
If you create a book and you create a table of contents like this one, you'll see that there's a sort

33
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,250
of hierarchy, right?

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,670
You've got the top-level headings here.

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,530
This would probably be a Level 1 heading, and these would be a Level 2 heading because they refer

36
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,180
to something that's more or less related to this Approval Section.

37
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,490
And you can see inside Section 8 here, there's even another subsection 8.1, which goes into more

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,280
detail about some aspect of 8.

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,300
This in our case might be an h3 heading.

40
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:58,270
These levels are what we get to define using our HTML headings.

41
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:07,540
This is what the code would look like for all six levels of headings and remember that there is no heading

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,290
seven.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,430
There is no such thing as an h7, that does not exist. Once you've gone to heading six,

44
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,410
that's pretty much the end as defined by the HTML people. And anything that's lower in importance, you would

45
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,940
start using a different type of tag, which will go into a little bit later on.

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,610
But for everything from one through to six, the structure is pretty much the same.

47
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,490
You've got an open tag, which is h1 or h6, and you've got a closing tag that has the corresponding

48
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,140
number.

49
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:47,140
Now, if you create a tag like this with an h1 and then you end with a different one like an h6,

50
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,210
then that's not going to work either.

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,850
Just remember that when you're writing your own code.

52
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,070
Now, what does this look like?

53
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,400
If we were to run this code, this is what we would get.

54
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,870
We would get different heading levels and by default, they would be styled to have different sizes.

55
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,310
So heading one being the biggest and heading six being the smallest.

56
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:15,340
We can of course further style this later on, but as soon as we type these headings, it just gives

57
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,820
us an indication of our levels to make sure that we've written all our code as intended.

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,950
And this essentially follows that structure we saw earlier on with the table of contents.

59
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:32,320
The Level 1 headings are the biggest and the Level 6 headings are the smallest.

60
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,200
So now that we've seen a little bit about how all of this works, let's try an exercise where we create

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,990
our own heading elements.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,440
To download the starting files, you have to go over to the course resources for this lesson and click

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,060
on the 2.1 Heading Element file in order to download it.

64
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,310
Now, if you don't know where that is, then you might have missed where at the very beginning of the

65
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,030
course, there's a lesson called, "How to Download the Course Resources," and in there I show you exactly

66
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,930
how to download each of the course resources for every single lesson.

67
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,060
So if you missed that, be sure to head over there to take a look and see how you can do this.

68
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:21,910
Now, once you've downloaded this file, it's really important that you extract it or what we call unzipping.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,250
Now, the first thing I want you to do is to create a folder for all of your web development projects,

70
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,130
and you can create that folder anywhere you like on your desktop in your C: drive, in your username

71
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,560
section, wherever you want, but just call it Web Development Projects, like this.

72
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,520
Now, once you've created that folder, then I want you to go ahead and open up the zipped file that you

73
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,400
just downloaded by double clicking on it.

74
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:57,450
And once you've opened up that zipped file, I want you to drag it into your Web Development Projects folder,

75
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,890
like this.

76
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,150
And then you'll be able to access them right here.

77
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,170
Now, the next step is we're going to open it up in VS Code.

78
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,310
Inside VS Code, go to file and we're going to create a new window.

79
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,160
Now open up the explorer here.

80
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,000
And then when we're here, we're going to open up our Web Development Projects folder that we just created,

81
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,480
and you should be able to see that folder heading element.

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,510
Now, if for some reason this is not working for you, especially if you're on Windows, this might

83
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,100
be because you haven't actually extracted this folder properly.

84
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,120
So again, make sure that you double-click on the zipped file, or on Windows,

85
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,510
you can also right-click on it and click extract.

86
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:50,900
And then once you've done that, drag, that folder that's been extracted into your Web Development

87
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,000
Projects folder and open up that folder inside your VS Code.

88
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:02,390
When you're here, you can see that there are three files in this folder called 2.1 Heading Element.

89
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,880
One is the index.html.

90
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:10,290
This is where you're going to be writing your code and I've got some starting code for you which we're

91
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,770
going to need to modify in order to complete this challenge.

92
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:20,220
Now you've also got the solution, which I don't recommend looking at until you've completed the challenge,

93
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,790
just to check your code or see if there's any differences.

94
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,430
Now notice how I've added a little bit here so that you don't accidentally see it unless you wanted

95
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,970
to.

96
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,110
But if you want to see the solution, just scroll down and you'll see it down there.

97
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:43,560
The goal of this exercise is to make the code here, create a website that looks like this.

98
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,780
Remember previously when we did our setup and download for VS Code, I showed you how to install the

99
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,580
extension, Live Preview.

100
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,770
If you don't see Live Preview when you click on extensions, that might mean that you've missed out

101
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,360
on some parts of that video.

102
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,690
So please go back to the setup and download videos for VS Code because there's some other things that

103
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,100
I need you to set up as well.

104
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,020
Make sure you don't skip any of these lessons unless you know exactly what you're doing and you're really

105
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,400
familiar with everything.

106
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,690
What that Live Preview allows us to do is to go into our code file index.html, right-click on it and

107
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,160
click show preview.

108
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,190
So it should now open up another pane and you can see it shows us our book chapters. Section 1,

109
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,800
Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Sections and Diagrams and Subsections.

110
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:38,010
Unfortunately, everything seems to be just on one long line, and if you drag it out, you can see

111
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,330
it's just one long line.

112
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,400
There's no formatting at all and there's no indication about hierarchy.

113
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,860
So that's where the challenge comes in.

114
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:54,660
You're going to use what you learned about heading elements in order to format this code here in the

115
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,820
index.html so that we end up with something that looks like this.

116
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,700
So we want the preview to show us Heading 1 elements, Heading 2 elements, Heading 3 elements.

117
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,330
And this one, this Diagram 1, is actually a Heading 4 element.

118
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,370
So you should have h1 through to h4 in your code here.

119
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:21,030
So now is the time to pause me in the video, and try to complete this challenge.

120
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:26,970
And after you're done, then you can resume the video and we'll walk through the solution together. Pause

121
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,890
the video now and give it a go.

122
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,770
All right.

123
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:40,480
So we're going to have a single h1 element up here, which is going to be for this word, Book.

124
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:48,250
So we're going to put an h1 element right here, and we're going to drag our, "Book," which is the

125
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:48,820
content

126
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,700
remember, in between these two tags, that's how our heading tags are formatted.

127
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,910
Now, the next one are these Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3 sections, and they're all going

128
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,500
to be the next level of hierarchy, which is an h2.

129
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,290
So let's do that for all three of them.

130
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:23,070
And then we can move on to our h3's, which is going to be the sections within the chapters.

131
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,690
And now I'm just going to fast forward through the rest of the code so that you don't get bored.

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,930
And then finally, this Diagram, which belongs inside Section 1, in Chapter 2, is going to be the

133
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,860
final and the lowest level of hierarchy, which is an h4.

134
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,120
And once we've completed all of this code, you can check yourself against the solution code and you

135
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,400
should see it's pretty much the same.

136
00:10:51,020 --> 00:11:00,320
Now, one of the things that you'll find is when you hit save using command + S or using file, save, you'll

137
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,810
see that it auto-formats our code so that we lose any of the indentation.

138
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,470
Don't worry if this happens to you, it's perfectly normal.

139
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,670
And if we check ourselves against the solution, you can see they match

140
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,600
exactly,

141
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,840
and we end up with the same result as the goal image, which is what we were aiming for.

142
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,960
How did you manage that?

143
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,750
Don't worry

144
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:30,170
if you got things wrong, this is where it's safe to go wrong and try things because we're just learning.

145
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,600
There's no tests and there's nobody watching you.

146
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,420
All that matters is you're actually learning stuff.

147
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,890
That's what's important.

148
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,590
Have a play around with the code.

149
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,260
Don't worry, if you do anything wrong, there's always a solution,

150
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,240
and me here to help you.

151
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,880
There's a couple of things to note in terms of do's and don'ts when it comes to heading elements that

152
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,390
I want to talk to you about.

153
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,990
One important rule is notice how in our exercise there was only one h1.

154
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,280
It's not good practice to have more than one h1 because the h1 is the very top-level heading.

155
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:11,340
Imagine the h1 as the book title and the table of contents as including the other parts.

156
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,520
So maybe the h2 would be the first chapter.

157
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,580
Don't have more than one h1.

158
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:26,400
Instead, if you need another subtitle or another level of heading, then go to the h2 or h3 or all

159
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,430
of the other ones up until h6.

160
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,710
Now the other thing to watch out for is don't skip a level.

161
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:40,440
When you're creating heading elements, don't go straight from h1 to h3.

162
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,170
If you have an h3, there should also be an h2 somewhere on that web page.

163
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,650
Instead, I recommend to just go in order when you have an h1 that you've created and then you realize

164
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,650
you need another heading, then go to an h2.

165
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:01,620
And then if you need another level of heading that's even lower in priority, go to an h3.

166
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,680
Don't jump between the different level headings.

167
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,710
These are not things that will break your code.

168
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,190
Your website will still look fine even if you break all of these rules,

169
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,140
but they're just rules for convention.

170
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,880
And because we're going to be professionals, we're going to start off on the right foot and learn all

171
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,740
the rules that we need to know.

172
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:27,350
Now, if you wanted to read up even more on the heading elements, then I recommend going to the professional

173
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:34,610
tool, which is our Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs, and they have documentation for all of the

174
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,950
HTML elements that exist.

175
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:43,070
And when you read up on each of these pages, they tell you more details about things that you need

176
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,630
to know, and they show you some interactive examples of how it all works.

177
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:53,750
Now, I don't recommend reading through all of these, for all of the HTML elements, but I do recommend

178
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,420
that if you're going to use a new element that you haven't seen before and you don't know how it works,

179
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:04,700
you haven't had a lecture on it, then I recommend just taking a quick look at the docs and seeing some

180
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,920
examples about how they're used in a similar way that I've shown you in the lectures.

181
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,800
Now that we've learned about one of the most important HTML elements, the heading elements, in the

182
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,960
next lesson, we're going to move on to another super important element which is the paragraph element.

183
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,450
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
