1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:09,110
Now let's get started by learning a little bit more about HTML, what exactly is it? And how do we use it to

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,340
create websites?

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:18,050
Now, no matter what browser you like to use, Chrome or Safari or Brave, even all of these applications

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,230
do the same thing.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:27,110
They take different files such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and they render them into a website.

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,100
But even though most modern websites are created using these three different file types combined together,

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,540
you can't create a website with just a CSS file or just a JavaScript file.

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,490
However, you can have just an HTML file.

9
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,800
And in fact, that's exactly what the first websites were created with, HTML.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,390
Now HTML defines the content and structure of the website.

11
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,960
So for example in this case, all that my HTML file does, is it renders a heading that says my website.

12
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:08,640
And when this file is opened by the browser, it will display that heading saying my website.

13
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,490
Now what exactly is HTML?

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,690
Let's break it down.

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,950
So HTML stands for hypertext markup language.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,940
If we look at the first part, hypertext, what does that mean?

17
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,600
Well, it refers to the pieces of text which can link to other documents in the website.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:37,830
So these pieces of text are hypertext or hyperlinks, and they are the foundation of how an HTML website

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,580
works.

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,560
Now, if we take a look at the world's first website created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who also happens

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,040
to be the inventor of the Internet, then you can see it's filled with these hyperlinks marked in blue.

22
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,600
And exactly as you would expect,

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,710
if you click on any of these hyperlinks, it takes you to another document, another HTML file.

24
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,600
So if we go back, you can see that we were on Project.html.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:14,880
And if I click on one of the hyperlinks like, "How can I help?" it will take me to another HTML file and

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,650
this is how hypertext works.

27
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,260
And there's even a link on this website explaining exactly what hypertext is.

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:28,080
So now that we know what hypertext is, what about the other part, the markup language?

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,910
What is a markup language?

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,870
Now, if you look at the English language, we often see little bits that function very similar to markup,

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,970
like these double quotes.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,690
The presence of these quotation marks is what tells a reader that this part is a quotation.

33
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:54,480
And as you'll find, this is going to be really similar to what you see in the editor's review of manuscript.

34
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,830
So used to mark them up and show different things, such as, for example, which parts need to be bold

35
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:09,830
by adding a squiggly line underneath it and which parts need to be underlined by adding a straight line

36
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,490
through it.

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,230
So how do you do markup with HTML?

38
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,670
Well, it's done through what's called HTML tags.

39
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,040
Now, in the early days of the Internet, there were only very few HTML tags.

40
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,310
These days there are loads more, but realistically, you're only going to be using some of the most

41
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,700
important ones such as headings, H1 through to H6, or the paragraph tag, the P tag.

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,570
So here you can see all of the HTML tags, but when we narrow it down to the ones that you actually

43
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,810
need to know, then it makes it a lot more approachable.

44
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,610
And in the rest of the course we're going to be covering some of the most essential tags,

45
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,400
and so don't worry about learning them.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,950
So don't worry about memorizing all of them or learning them.

47
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,690
We're going to cover them as we need them in our projects and in our exercises.

48
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,610
So in the next lesson, we're going to get started by learning about the heading tag, one of the most

49
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,940
OG HTML tags that ever existed.

50
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,360
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
