1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,330
Well done 

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,970
for completing the first module. You've already come so far just by taking the first step, because

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,910
you know that most people who buy online courses, they never get started.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,870
So you're already one step closer to your goal.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,820
But we all know that at some point later on, things will get more difficult.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,440
It will get more challenging.

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,010
I can promise you this already.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:33,450
So how can you keep this current level of motivation that you have and be able to carry it through to

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,380
the difficult times?

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:42,300
One of the things that I find really helpful is setting goals and having my goals around me, like displayed

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,260
on the wall while I'm working or while I'm studying.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:53,220
So I've created this fantastic worksheet for you so that you can start thinking about why you're doing

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,700
this.

14
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,430
Why are you learning to code?

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,240
Why are you learning the skill?

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,540
What will you be able to achieve once you've mastered it?

17
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,600
And what would your life look like once that happens?

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,120
So head over to the next lesson,

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,750
fill out the sheet with your answers and then print it out and put it somewhere where you can see it

20
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,780
so that when things become difficult and when your motivation takes a nosedive, you can have a look

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,840
at it and remind yourself of why you're doing it in the first place.

22
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,420
So head over there now.
