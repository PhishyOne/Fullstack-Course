1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,310
So now that we've gotten an introduction to HTML, I want you to put everything you've learned together

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,630
in order to create a new project.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,530
So the project that we're going to be building today is called The Favorite Movie Project.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,910
It's going to be a website to keep track of all of your favorite movies that you've watched. When you

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,580
go to rogerebert.com, he is one of the greatest film critics of all time

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:34,460
in fact. He's passed away now, but he's got movie reviews and ratings for all the movies that he's

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,120
watched.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,850
And you can see that when you go to his website.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,960
I think this is a really great way of keeping track of what you've watched.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,450
Because when friends ask me for recommendations, I can never remember what it is that I've watched

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,970
in this year that I really like and what to recommend.

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,890
So what we're going to be building today is a very simple website.

13
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:02,580
It's going to be a website that tracks your favorite movies maybe of all time, maybe of the last year,

14
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,810
whatever you want to do.

15
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,940
And the requirement is you should have at least three movies that you put in here.

16
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,640
So what you're going to need is to create a h1 as the title of the website, and then you're going to

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,910
have an h2 as the subtitle, and then you're going to have a horizontal rule as your void element in

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,530
there.

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,360
And then you're going to have three movies that you're going to list and they're all going to be created

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
using the h3 element.

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,010
And then finally you should have a section which is going to be a paragraph element that's going to

22
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,190
describe why you liked those movies.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,690
And this is basically a very simple format for this website.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,710
Now feel free once you've done all of this to continue to mould this website, to change it up, to add

25
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,620
things, to add break elements, whatever it is you want to do

26
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,930
b ut at the minimum, I want to see all of these elements represented on a page.

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,350
And of course, feel free to add your own movies

28
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:17,070
and I would love to see in the Q and A a picture of your website to see what it is that are your top

29
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,640
movies

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
and maybe I'll get some inspiration

31
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,010
to the next time when I have movie night and I can't figure out what to watch.

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,550
So I'm curious to see your recommendations as well.

33
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:34,950
So go ahead and download the movie ranking project zip file from this lesson's course resources.

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,170
If you don't know how to do that again, go back to one of the first videos in the course at the very

35
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,170
beginning of Section 1 where I showed you in a video how to download course resources.

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,490
And once you've unzipped it and extracted it, then open it up in VS Code and go ahead and code to your

37
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,040
heart's content using everything you've learned.

38
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,680
Pause the video now and give that a go.

39
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,270
Now let's go through the solution.

40
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,040
In my case, I'm going to have an h1 at the top, which is going to be the title.

41
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:18,440
So Top Movies of All Time According to Angela.

42
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:28,580
And then afterwards, I'm going to create a subtitle which I will write, My Best 3 movies.

43
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:36,110
And then after that we were going to add a horizontal rule to separate this part from the actual content

44
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,220
of our website.

45
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,530
And I'm going to create an h3  to represent each of the movies I'm going to recommend.

46
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,430
So I'm going to recommend Spirited Away, which is one of my favorite animes.

47
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,790
And I'm going to use a paragraph tag to describe a little bit about why I like it.

48
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,370
So I'm just going to call it favorite anime.

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,520
And then the next movie We will be Ex Machina.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,940
And I really liked it because it's a really cool sci fi movie.

51
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:24,520
And then finally, the third one is going to be the movie, Drive with Ryan Gosling because it was really

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,080
beautifully shot.

53
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,910
Cool.

54
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:37,520
This is the basics of what you would need to have done for this project.

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,890
It has all of the elements that were required and you can see in the goal PNG that it's got all the

56
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,160
things that we've described, even if the text is a little bit different.

57
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:53,510
Of course it won't be, according to Angela for you, it will be according to your name.

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:59,600
And now that you've done that, feel free to add different things in here as you would want.

59
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,640
Maybe add a bit more to the paragraph tags, maybe add a poem about your favorite movie, go crazy,

60
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:14,300
try out things and share in the Q&A your project as a screenshot.

61
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,070
If you don't know how to do a screenshot, be sure to type that into Google, 

62
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,660
how do I create a screenshot?

63
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,110
And then you can add it into the Q&A and we can all look at your favorite movies and be inspired.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,930
So I hope you enjoyed building the project together.

65
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:39,060
And in the next section we're going to dive a little bit deeper into some more intermediate aspects

66
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,320
of HTML.

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,350
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
