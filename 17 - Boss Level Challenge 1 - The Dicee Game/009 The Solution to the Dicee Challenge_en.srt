1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,890
All right.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,690
So how did that go?

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:09,090
Now I want you to really give this a good go before you come and check the solutions because this really

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,480
is how you're going to prove to yourself that you've actually internalized and learned all of this information

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,650
that we've been teaching you.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,260
But once you have done and if you want to check the solution or you just want to fix a particular bug

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,480
or see how I did it then go ahead and continue watching.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,820
So we first start off, this is the web site that we've got, and notice that it's already been styled and

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,290
it's already set up so that we can start writing Javascript.

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,010
Now there's just one problem. We currently don't have a Javascript file, so we're going to go into a project

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:48,180
and we're going to create a new file that's called index.js.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,530
So now that we have our Javascript file, it's still not linked to our index.html. Just as we linked

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,200
up our style sheet in the CSS sections,

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,459
we have to link up our index.js. And the best place to do that is just before the end of the body.

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,820
So we're going to create a script tag that has an external source, and the source is going to be index.js.

16
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:19,290
So now we can test this by simply writing an alert that says "Working!".

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,770
And now, if we reload our web site and we get our alert, then we know that our Javascript has been linked

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,690
up without any issues.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:27,920
All right.

20
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,090
So that's step one.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,730
Now the next thing we want to do is to place some images into our image elements by default,

22
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:43,450
so when our web site starts up it should have two images of the die six face already showing.

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,890
So we know that our images are located in a folder called images, and they're numbered dice1 through to

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,010
dice6.

25
00:01:51,150 --> 00:02:00,600
So we can simply change the src here to images/dice6.png, and we can do the same thing

26
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,530
over here.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,070
And now if we hit save and refresh we've got some dice on the page.

28
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
Looking pretty good. All right.

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,610
So that's step two.

30
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:20,090
Now step three involves going into our index.js and generating some random numbers that we're going

31
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,410
to be using to select a random dice face.

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,040
So we first have to create a variable called randomNumber1,

33
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,760
and remember that to create a random number, we simply use the method Math.random, and this will generate

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,780
a number between 0 and 0.9999999 recurring.

35
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,670
So in our case we need a random number between 1 and 6.

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,380
So we need to multiply this random number that we get by 6.

37
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:01,790
So if the random number was between 0 and 0.9, then we now have a number between 0 and 5. And

38
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,060
we can't have that random number be a decimal number,

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:12,000
so we need it to be a whole number. And we can do that by rounding it down using Math.floor.

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,660
So remember that if at any point you're not quite sure what your code is doing, you can always just

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,250
copy it and paste it into your console and just run it to see what the values are.

42
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,950
So we're currently getting random numbers between 0 and 5.

43
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:36,170
So to change that range from 0 to 5 to 1 to 6 all we need today is just to add one.

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:44,610
So let's recap on this method. We're generating a random number between 0 and 0.99999.

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,600
Then we're multiplying that number,

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:55,250
whatever it may be, by 6, in order to change it to between 0 and 5.99999.

47
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,420
Then we're rounding that number down to the nearest whole number,

48
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,030
so it becomes between zero and five.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:11,390
And finally we're changing that range from between 0 and 5 to between 1 and 6 by simply adding 1 to

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,040
the number.

51
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:18,860
And you can verify each step of this code by simply testing it out inside the console.

52
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,430
Now if any of this seem confusing then make sure that you go back to our lesson on randomization where

53
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,010
we talked about this in more detail.

54
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:34,940
All right. So now we have a randomNumber1 which is going to give us a random number between 1 and

55
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:43,160
6 and then we're going to use this random number to select a random dice image.

56
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:50,120
So you might notice that our dice images are very handily named from dice1 through to dice6.

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,800
So we can simply use concatenation to add this number to the end of the string 'dice', and get our random

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,910
dice image.

59
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:06,780
So let's create a variable called randomDiceImage, and we can create this using concatenation.

60
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:13,600
So we can say "dice" + randomNumber1 + ".png".

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,400
So this will be a string that is from dice1.png through to dice6.png.

62
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:29,080
So we can now use that string to change the source of our image to that random image name.

63
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:34,760
So the next part is changing that attribute value for the source.

64
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,210
So at the moment it's just a static image,

65
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,700
it's always going to show dice6. But we're going to change this string based on the random number that

66
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,680
we got back.

67
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,740
So, in order to change it, we have to tap into the src attribute of our image element.

68
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:58,580
So notice that the source is actually not just the name of the image but it also has the folder that

69
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,670
the images are contained in,

70
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,500
and that's because all of our dice images are nested inside this folder called images, which is how we

71
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,560
would normally organize our assets.

72
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:18,860
So in order to include that name we also have to add it by concatenation. So we can say var 

73
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,860
randomImageSource = "images", which is the name of the folder,

74
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,160
notice that it's a plural, with an s, and then / + 

75
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,190
randomDiceImage.

76
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,870
Now this step is optional, because you can also add it in here,

77
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,310
but I think it's just easier for you to see what's going on,

78
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,460
so I'm leaving it as a separate line here.

79
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:49,390
So now what we'll get back inside this variable will be something like images/dice1.png

80
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,800
through to images/dice6.png.

81
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:01,190
So now we're ready to change the src attribute of our image element.

82
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,100
So do you remember how you can change the attributes of the elements?

83
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,250
Well before we do anything we have to first select the element.

84
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:17,780
So we'll say document.querySelectorAll, because we actually have two images that we need to change

85
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,430
rather than just selecting the first one.

86
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,600
So we're going to use querySelectorAll, and we're going to select based on our img tag.

87
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:32,480
So we're going to get two of these back and to tap into the first one we just have to specify the index

88
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,610
0 inside a square bracket.

89
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:41,840
So now we can either assign this to a variable, say var image1 equals this document.querySelector

90
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,200
image at index 0, or you can simply just continue along that same line.

91
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
But let's make it easier to see

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,260
by separating it all out.

93
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:59,120
So now we've got image1, and we can now set its attribute by using the method setAttribute.

94
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:06,200
Now, in this case, the first input in here has to be the attribute's name that you want to change.

95
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,010
And in our case the one that we want to change is the attribute called src.

96
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,290
So let's put that in there.

97
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,310
And the second parameter, or the second input, is what we want to change it to.

98
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,400
So we want to change it to our randomImageSource.

99
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,570
So we'll just put that variable in there, randomImageSource.

100
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,539
So now if we hit save and we go back to our web site and we refresh it, then you can see that every time

101
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:45,290
that we refresh the web site we get a new random dice showing up on the left, and it's going between dice1.png

102
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,820
through to dice6.png.

103
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,920
All right. So now we have to do exactly the same thing for the second image element.

104
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,850
Now very often you will be tempted to copy and paste code.

105
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,620
And I just want you to hear my voice in your head whenever you do that to remember that it's probably

106
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:14,180
better to just write out the code for extra coding practice, because when you copy and paste code, especially

107
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,230
in a case like this, I will bet that you will probably get at least one or two bugs.

108
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,860
So let's just write out our code instead.

109
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,060
Now the first thing we need to create is a randomNumber2.

110
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,710
And this is going to equal exactly the same thing

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,650
Math.floor

112
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:40,990
Math.random, multiply that by 6, and then add 1 to the value.

113
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,700
So now we can use randomNumber2 to create the second random dice image.

114
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,850
So in this case I'm going to make it a little bit simpler and we can cut down on these two lines of

115
00:09:50,850 --> 00:10:07,890
code. So we can simply say var randomImageSource2 = "images/dice" + randomNumber2

116
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,190
+ ".png".

117
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,980
So now we have our randomImageSource2. Then we can go ahead and perform the next two steps, which

118
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,300
I'll combine into one line as well,

119
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,690
so you can see how you can do it.

120
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:28,380
So we're going to use document.querySelectorAll, and we're going to select our img element, and

121
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,740
we're going to grab the second one in the array, so we're going to tap into the one at index 1.

122
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:43,050
Now that we've gotten this element using these lines of code, we're going to set its attribute, and the

123
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,710
attribute we're going to set is src, and the value we're going to set it to is randomImageSource2.

124
00:10:50,060 --> 00:11:00,770
So now if we hit save and we refresh, then you can see that both our dices are generating new random

125
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,890
dice images.

126
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,550
It's pretty neat,

127
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:08,690
right? Now the next step we have to address is the title, and we're going to change the innerHTML

128
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,770
of the title depending on what was the result of the dice roll.

129
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,540
So we can use an if statement to do this.

130
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:25,010
We can say that if randomNumber1 was greater than randomNumber2, then in that case that means

131
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,450
player 1 won.

132
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,380
So we're going to tap into the h1 by saying document.querySelector, because in this case we only

133
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:40,560
have one h1, and we're going to say .innerHTML equals,

134
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,180
you can put whatever you want here,

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,220
but I'm just going to say "Player 1 Wins!", and I'm going to add a emoji tag in here.

136
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,370
So, on a Mac, if you wanted to add emojis then you can simply go into Edit, Emoji & Symbols, and on 

137
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,520
Windows you can simply search for the flag emoji

138
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,400
inside Google Chrome.

139
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,120
So this is the case where if player 1 wins.

140
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:13,610
So the next one is going to be an else if, and in this case this is, what if randomNumber2 was greater

141
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,630
than randomNumber1?

142
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,380
Then clearly that means that player 2 won.

143
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:31,480
So we'll say document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Player 2 Wins!".

144
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:39,410
Now finally, the third scenario is, what if randomNumber1 actually equaled randomNumber2?

145
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,560
Well, in that case

146
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:51,830
we'll address it with an else statement, and we'll say document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML =

147
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,080
"Draw!". Cool.

148
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:02,560
So now if we hit save and we refresh our page then you can see that depending on the dice roll then

149
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,000
we'll tell the user which player won, or whether there was a draw.

150
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,700
So I hope you had fun with this challenge and it helped you to get to grips with a lot of the things

151
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,100
that we've been learning in these past few lessons.

152
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,760
Now of course, depending on how you wrote your code, it could have been a lot shorter or a lot longer, or you

153
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:29,390
might have used different ways, like say getElementById, or getElementByTagName, instead of 

154
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,490
querySelector or querySelectorAll.

155
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,860
And of course if you wanted to refactor your code and make it a lot shorter then you can always do that.

156
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,570
But always remember that there is a healthy balance between really short code and expressive code that

157
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,290
anybody could understand when they came around.

158
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,850
So I would say something like this is probably a little bit too long but I think it helps to see what's

159
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,320
going on

160
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,220
exactly every step of the way.

161
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:04,070
Now if you were to go even more extreme and to say, you know, instead move this into here and then move

162
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,980
this into here.

163
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,280
Now this code will still work but having such a long line of code where everything is happening all

164
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,460
in one place is a little bit much,

165
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,700
and it makes it harder for anybody else who comes along to understand what's going on in your code.

166
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,220
So I recommend aiming for that healthy balance and aiming to keep your code really really readable.

167
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,310
Now in the next module we're going to be digging into some more intermediate parts of the Document Object

168
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:38,260
Model, and we're going to see how we can respond to events such as button clicks and also keyboard strokes.

169
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,320
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
