Hey.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,280
Well done for completing yet another module.

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,390
Man you're really getting these like modules like out of the way.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:15,240
Now I want to share with you another tip of mine that has really helped me to be able to concentrate

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,239
better.

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:25,650
And the trick is to basically study or, when I'm working, work on something that's hard, that I've put

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,290
off,

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:34,740
when I'm in a fasted state, so that means the first thing when I wake up in the morning. I brush my teeth,

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:44,190
and I sit down, and I just do this difficult thing. And I find that, you know, when you have lunch, and especially

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:53,370
if you have something quite heavy, like in carbs, like a pizza or something, you feel your brain like going

11
00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:01,050
to sleep, right? It's like really really hard to concentrate and everything just feels so, 'Oh, like I can't

12
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,550
wait to just go home.

13
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:11,370
I can't think.'. And I find that if you try to work when you're in like the opposite of that, when you've

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,180
just woken up, you haven't eaten anything yet, maybe you've had a black coffee but nothing that has any

15
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,850
sort of calorific value, right? In that moment,

16
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,320
I am like the sharpest as can be, and I found that, you know, through tweaking with my diet sometimes, like

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,910
especially like not having such a heavy lunch or not having so much carbs for lunch,

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,310
I find that I can think more clearly, but nothing beats that early morning and fasted, that early morning

19
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,650
fasted state,

20
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:52,350
and I'm just able to think more clearly. Now make sure, be safe, if you have diabetes or if you have

21
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,180
some other condition that like, that doesn't allow you to do this, then don't do it.

22
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,100
It's just a suggestion. It's just something that works for me.

23
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,000
So have a go at that and keep going.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,370
You're getting really really far in the course now.
