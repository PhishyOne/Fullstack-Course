1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,140
Now jQuery also makes it really easy to implement some common animations that you might want to do when

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,480
you're creating your web site.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,930
So let's head into Atom, and inside our index.js at the moment

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:19,250
we’ve got a click listener on all of our buttons that changes our h1 CSS to the color purple.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,620
Now if we were to delete this method, so instead of using .css we use something like .hide,

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,690
and this method is an animation that will hide the selected element.

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,410
So when we click any button in our web page it should try and hide the h1.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,080
So let's see what that looks like.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,130
Let's refresh the page and you can see that our h1 disappears when I click on any of the buttons.

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,340
Now if we wanted to show that h1 instead, we would have to select our h1 and say .show.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,340
And that will make it reappear.

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:03,930
Now if instead of only making our h1 hide and disappear forever, we wanted to toggle the hide and show,

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,000
then we can simply say toggle.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,410
So now when I click on any button it'll hide my h1.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,760
And then when I click on any other button it will show my h1. And I can toggle it's appearance 

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,350
by clicking on my buttons.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,850
Now hiding is a very sudden kind of event.

18
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,480
It disappears and the element gets removed from the flow of our HTML, so everything else moves up.

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,860
And this is a very sudden sort of disappearance and appearance.

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:37,290
Now if we wanted that to be a little bit more progressive then we can use something called fadeOut instead.

21
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,130
And you can see that when I click now it’ll reduce the opacity of my selected element, and then it

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,130
will hide it.

23
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:53,400
And of course fadeOut has its related opposite which is fadeIn, and that will make our h1 appear

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,520
and also fade into full opacity.

25
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,780
Now all of these methods come with a toggle option, so fadeToggle will allow our buttons to fade out, then

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,900
fade in, then fade out.

27
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,240
I can do this all day long.

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:08,919
All right.

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,080
So in addition to fading and hiding you can also use a slideUp and slideDown.

30
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:23,080
And what this does is it kind of just collapses our element that was selected, and slide down

31
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,140
will just uncollapse that element. And again slideUp comes with slideToggle.

32
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:38,220
So this will just slide up, slide down, slide up, slide down, and this can be really useful if you have

33
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,670
something like a drop down menu for example.

34
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,120
Now if you wanted more fine grained control over your animations then instead of using these pre-built

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,610
ones you can use something called .animate.

36
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,720
And this allows you to define some custom

37
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,620
CSS that you want to gradually animate towards. So inside the parentheses we can insert a set of curly

38
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,430
braces, and inside the curly braces we're going to add our new CSS rule that we're going to animate to.

39
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:15,380
So, for example, I can change the opacity of my selected element to only 0.5,

40
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,250
so 50 percent of its previous value.

41
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,290
So now if we hit save and refresh and I click on one of these buttons you can see that my element just

42
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,810
got a lot more transparent, and it might be a little bit easier if I changed the color to something a bit

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,260
more easy to see like say purple.

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,860
You can see that clearly makes the opacity much much lower.

45
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,110
Now the thing to remember about the animate method is that in between the curly braces you can only

46
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,180
add the CSS rules that have a numeric value.

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,770
So that means that you can’t animate to something like a color,

48
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,050
right?

49
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,580
You can't change the color to red.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,050
And when I run this you can see that we get an error.

51
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,440
Red is not defined.

52
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,920
And this is because it's very difficult to create that kind of tween animation that gradually progresses

53
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,380
from one style to another using the animate method.

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,560
So you have to stick to things that have a numeric value.

55
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,149
For example a margin of 20 pixels, that it can do.

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,320
Or if you wanted to make it a percentage, then you can include it as a string.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,580
So 20 percent margin which makes it much bigger.

58
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,580
But essentially make sure that this second value in the CSS that you're trying to animate to is a number

59
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,550
value.

60
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,530
Now if you wanted to have more than one of these animations happening then you can chain them together.

61
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,130
So what do I mean by chaining?

62
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,040
So for example if we wanted our h1 to slide up,

63
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:59,070
but then after it slid up, I then want it to slide down, and after it slid down I want to change the CSS 

64
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,060
to have an opacity of 0.5,

65
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,300
so 50 percent.

66
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,110
So essentially what we've done here is chained

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,580
three methods together so that we target our h1 and first get it to slide up, then slide down, then

68
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,450
animate.

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:22,410
Now remember that if this is all targeting the same thing it can't slide up and slide down at the same

70
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:22,960
time.

71
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,490
So it will do it in order.

72
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,800
So let's check it out.

73
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,120
Slide up, down and change opacity.

74
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,730
So that's pretty cool, right?

75
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,220
And if you're worried right now that you can't remember what all of these methods are called or how

76
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,290
to use them then don't worry.

77
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,200
As programmers we try to save the sacred space that is our brain.

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,570
So never try to remember or memorize anything.

79
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,430
That's not what it's about.

80
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,980
Essentially for me programming is basically like an open book exam, and nobody memorizes things for open

81
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,260
book exams, right?

82
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:04,050
You just try to understand what's going on because remember that there is always the documentation and

83
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,920
the whole world wide web out there to help you in the exact moment that you need the information. You

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,260
just need to know that they exist and roughly what they were called or what they're able to do.

85
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,260
So for example if we couldn't remember how to use slideUp, then we could search for something like,

86
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,020
so we know it's about jQuery,

87
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:30,710
and we know that it was an animation, and we know that we needed to slide something, right?

88
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,510
So let's hit enter.

89
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,370
And you can see that we've already got access to our slideDown event.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,690
And if we looked a little bit further upstream than we can see all of our effects: animate, delay, fadeIn,

91
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,390
fadeOut, fadeTo.

92
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,120
And this is the jQuery documentation which is searchable on here, on jquery.com, but it's actually

93
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,490
much easier to just search through Google, because it gives you the most relevant results, and it might

94
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,190
give you the W3 Schools or the MDN,

95
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,510
but jQuery is extensively documented.

96
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,900
And even if it's not in the documentation, somebody would have already asked a question on Stack Overflow,

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,410
or somebody will be able to help you on Stack Overflow with your questions.

98
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,530
So never memorize.

99
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,500
Always remember that all the resources that you need are just a few keystrokes away.

100
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,470
Now I hope you're ready for a challenge because I've got a big challenge for you.

101
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,900
This is definitely a boss level

102
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:37,380
fight. Now we're going to create a game using jQuery, and in the process you'll be able to consolidate

103
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,400
what we've learned in this module and reassure yourself that you've absorbed all of this information.

104
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,470
So once you’re ready, head over to the next module.
