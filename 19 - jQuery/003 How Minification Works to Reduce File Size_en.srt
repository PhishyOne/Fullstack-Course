00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,039
Now for the inquisitive ones amongst you you might have copied this URL where our jQuery library

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:16,200
resides and tried to take a look at it. And if you did this is what you would see, it looks like a huge

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,010
mess.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,330
But this is essentially the minified version of the jQuery library.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,040
And you might notice that it looks very similar from the Bootstrap CDN that we used previously.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,330
When you copy the URL there and paste it and load it in your browser, then you can see again you

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,980
have this huge mess of code.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,810
Now what exactly is all of this?

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,500
Let's take a section of this and copy it, and inside Atom I'm going to open a new page.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm going to show you what this minification does.

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,470
So essentially we've still got the same Bootstrap code.

12
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,340
So in the case of Bootstrap then it is CSS,

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,920
and in the case of jQuery then it's Javascript code.

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:14,700
But essentially all of the spaces, the new lines, the comments, have been removed from the file to try

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,400
and reduce its size.

16
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,490
But you can see that as I've been combing through this and separating out these lines into the familiar

17
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,000
formatting that we're used to, then you can see that it's just CSS code.

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,000
And this is simply just Javascript code.

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,850
And in fact if you head over to minifier.org, which is a way of converting your Javascript or CSS

20
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,470
code to a minified version.

21
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,880
Now to test it out I've got our index.js from our drumkit code and at the top I'm going to add

22
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,170
a comment.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,250
This is a comment. And you can see that it's got a lot of spaces, new lines, new paragraphs.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,190
But we're going to copy its entirety by just hitting command or control A and then command or control

25
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,300
C, and then we're going to take it over to our minifier and we're going to paste that in.

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:14,220
And now we're going to select Javascript and hit Minify, and you can see that it's just crunched everything

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,500
together and got rid of comments.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,120
So now you can see that our original script was 1539 bytes, our 

29
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:29,720
minified script is only 1113 bytes.

30
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:37,260
So we have gained 426 bytes, making our files smaller and therefore quicker for our users to load.

31
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,650
And this is exactly the reason why we minify our Javascript or our CSS, because all of this code has

32
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,830
to be loaded up by your users' browser.

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,060
Now depending on their Internet speed, that may take a short time or a long time. Now because the browser

34
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,090
doesn't care about tabs, indents, spaces and comments, it completely ignores all of it,

35
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,270
there's no point asking the user to load up all of this unnecessary information, and by minifying

36
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,210
we get rid of those things and make our web site load much faster.

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,920
So if you download the jQuery library straight up then you'll see something that looks a bit like

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,770
this.

39
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:25,830
Now as with all libraries they'll come up with a standard version that is human readable and they'll

40
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,620
also have a minified version that's just intended for the browser.

41
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:38,310
And this is so that you can customize the code if you wish and then minify it yourself, or if you don't

42
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,330
want to do any customization then simply to just drop the jQuery file into your project.

43
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,720
All right.

44
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,920
So in the next lesson we're actually going to be getting down and dirty and actually exploring all the

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,930
things that you can do with jQuery, starting by selecting elements.

46
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,470
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
