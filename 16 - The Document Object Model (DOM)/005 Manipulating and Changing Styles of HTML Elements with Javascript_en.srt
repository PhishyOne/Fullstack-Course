1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:00,840
All right.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:07,200
So now that we know how to select elements using the DOM, it's time to learn how to use Javascript to

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,060
manipulate the elements that we've selected.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:18,030
Now, as you saw earlier on, we were able to change the CSS style dynamically using Javascript by tapping

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,060
into the style property of an element object.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:31,320
So, for example, we could say document.querySelector(“h1”).style.color = “red”.

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,750
And that selects on the h1 element in our document, changes the style color to a red color.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,510
Now every single CSS property can be changed in this way using Javascript, but the property names might

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,610
look a little bit different.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,830
As we said earlier on, Javascript naming conventions tend to be camel cased.

11
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,760
So, for example querySelector, where the first word is lowercase

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,940
and the second word begins with an uppercase letter.

13
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,390
This is camel casing and this is standard for naming methods and properties in Javascript.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,720
So that means that when you're trying to change the CSS styles, you will find that the property names

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,830
don't look quite the same as what you see in CSS.

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:24,660
So, for example, we might have things like font size, which is font-size as the property name in CSS,

17
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,810
but if you're trying to change it using Javascript, then the property is going to be camel cased like

18
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,530
so.

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,780
So let's change the font size to, I don’t know, something massive, 10rem. And you can find all of those names inside

20
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,750
the DOM style object documentation and you'll see all of these properties and what they look like when

21
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,910
you're trying to change it using Javascript instead of CSS.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,200
And I'll leave a link to this in the resources of this current lesson so you can check it out.

23
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,740
But, as a rule of thumb, in most cases they're exactly the same,

24
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,440
other than the fact that there are no dashes and every word after the first one will have its first

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,000
letter capitalized.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,420
The other thing to notice is that the values that you're going to set it to have to be represented as

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:20,370
strings. Whereas in CSS we simply just specified the value as is, for example padding 7 percent, if we're

28
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,760
trying to do this with Javascript, then we actually have to specify everything as a string, even if it's

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,770
a number, like line height or padding.

30
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,460
So, just so you can see more clearly, I'm inside the Elements tab of the Chrome Developer Tools,

31
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,600
and as you might remember, you can quite easily select an item over here and change its CSS by just typing

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,530
it inside here,

33
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,930
so say visibility is hidden, and that hides our h1.

34
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,250
But if we wanted to do the same thing using Javascript, then we would have to specify that value “hidden”

35
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,480
as a string.

36
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,720
So remember those two differences.

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,180
Now it's your turn to try it out.

38
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:11,240
I want you to use Javascript only to change the background color of our button here to a yellow color.

39
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,230
And you might have to take a look at the object style properties or you can just give it a go and see

40
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,630
if you can predict what it might be.

41
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,840
So pause the video now and give that challenge a go.

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,110
All right.

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,600
So you might already realize that in order to change the background color of our button, then in CSS you

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,310
would simply just tap into the background color property and you would set it to yellow.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,810
And that would achieve what we wanted.

46
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,460
But because we have to do it using Javascript, then we need to know the Javascript version of that background

47
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,570
color property.

48
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,070
So if we head over to our Style Object Properties documentation and we hit command f and we search for background

49
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,150
color, then you can see that it brings up the property

50
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,520
that’s called backgroundColor.

51
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,220
And as some of you might have predicted it's simply the same property without the dash and camel case.

52
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,430
So let's now use it inside our console.

53
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,680
So we're going to tap into the document and query for the selector

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:22,200
that is a button, and change its style property, namely the background color property, to, remember the value

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,990
has to be specified as a string,

56
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,130
so it's the word yellow

57
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,390
inside some quotation marks.

58
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,830
Now if we hit enter, our Javascript code has turned the background color of the button yellow.

59
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,580
So if you found that difficult at all,

60
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,350
then I recommend going through some of the other properties that we've been using in CSS and trying

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,870
to do it using Javascript instead,

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,420
and have a play around with the Chrome Developer Tools until you really get it.

63
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,630
Now in the next lesson we're going to learn all about the separation of concerns and how we can keep

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,230
our style inside the CSS but toggle it on and off using Javascript.

65
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,240
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
