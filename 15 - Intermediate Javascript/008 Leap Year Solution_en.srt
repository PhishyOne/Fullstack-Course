00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,840
Alright, so let's try to tackle this challenge step by step. Now, if we look at the flowchart, the first

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,160
question we ask is, is it cleanly divisible by 4?

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,210
If no, then it's definitely not a leap year.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,000
If yes, then we have to ask more questions.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,080
So how would we write this in terms of code?

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,390
Well, we'd probably use an if statement to check if the year that were being passed in here is cleanly

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,570
divisible by 4.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,710
And remember that on a previous lesson, which I linked to here, we learned about the modulo operator

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,270
which gives you the remainder of a division.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:46,050
So if the year % 4 is equal to zero, namely if there is no remainder when you divide the

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,110
year by 4, well in that case then it's likely to be a leap year.

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,580
But if it's not even divisible by four, then it's definitely not a leap year.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,560
So here we could simply return 'Not leap year.'

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,209
So any year that is not divisible by 4, then it's definitely not a leap year.

15
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,690
But if it is divisible by 4, we still have to check

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,510
is it cleanly divisible by 100?

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,690
Because if no, then it's definitely a leap year,

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,280
but if yes, then we have to check further.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,210
So the best way to represent that logic is to create another if statement inside this if statement.

20
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,040
So it's already divisible by 4

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,580
but we have to check whether if it's divisible by 100.

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:37,680
So if the year % 100 is equal to zero, well, then we have to make some further checks.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,550
But if it's not, then it's definitely a leap year. So we can return leap year.

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,350
Now, finally, we're in the homestretch and we have to ask ourselves the last question.

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,410
Is it cleanly divisible by 400?

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,400
If no, then it's not a leap year,

27
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,300
if yes, then it is a leap year.

28
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:02,010
So inside this if statement, we're going to ask ourselves one further question:

29
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:10,919
if the year is divisible by 400 and that has no remainder, well, then it's definitely a leap year.

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,210
And if that's not true, then it's definitely not a leap year.

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:25,340
So this is the logic that we saw in the flowchart mapped out with JavaScript code. And going from these

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,370
words to code is actually quite a big jump.

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,960
But going via that middle ground, that flowchart, makes it so much easier to actually map out the logic

34
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,210
and then converting it into code.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,390
So I hope you enjoyed that challenge and you managed to get it right.

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:48,560
And at least if you didn't, you saw how you can use flowcharts to simplify and clarify your own idea

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,960
of the logic, because at the end of the day, the code is easy, but the logic is the part that you

38
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,950
got to get right first.

39
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,480
So now if we check our solution, then everything should pass.
