1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,689
All right, so this was a relatively simple code challenge, and the goal is very simple. Given that we've

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:12,900
got a function called whosPaying and we pass in an array of names like this one,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,820
our function should be able to pick out a random name from this array and be able to return the output

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,250
that one of these people is going to buy lunch today.

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,990
So let's see how we might tackle this. Now in order to pick out an item from the array, we would tap

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,270
into the array and we would use a square bracket to select an item.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,360
So if we said [0], then that's going to pull out the item at position zero which

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,260
is the first one.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,880
And if we did names [4], then that's going to be 0,

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,480
1, 2, 3, 4, and it's going to pull up the last item from the array.

11
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,600
So now we basically need a random number that is in the range of 0 to 4 if the input was this

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,019
long.

13
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,930
But we don't know how long the input could be,

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,300
right?

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,660
It could be an array of names as long as my arm.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,530
So given that we don't know that information, let's first work that out.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,230
Let's create a variable called numberOfPeople which is going to be equal to names.length.

18
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,380
And this is going to calculate in this array that we got past how many names are there,

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:25,860
right?

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,000
Because once we've got that information, then we can work out a random person's position,

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,410
right?

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,990
So we could say that the randomPersonPosition = math.random, which is going to generate

23
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,710
a number between 0 and 1 and not including 1.

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,360
And then we can multiply it by the numberOfPeople

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,950
then we would get a range of numbers from 0 to 0.9999 recurring.

26
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,360
So now if we multiply it by the total number of people, so the number of items in this array,

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,140
so in this example, we would have five.

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,759
So zero multiplied by five is going to be zero, but 0.999 multiplied by five is going to

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,150
become 4.9999.

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,310
So now all we have to do is use the math.floor to cut off everything that's at the end of the decimal

31
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:20,700
place

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,000
and then we get our range 0 to 4.

33
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,050
So let's go ahead and do that.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
So I'm going to wrap everything inside a math.floor

35
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:38,640
and now this randomPersonPosition should be a random number between 0 and the total number

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,220
OfPeople - 1, giving us all of the indices that we need to get each item in the array.

37
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,540
So now all that's to do is to pick out the random person.

38
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,980
And to do that, we tap into the list of names, use our square brackets and pass in the randomPerson position.

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,190
Now that we've got our random person, all that we have to do is provide this output.

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,810
So let's return this output and we're going to return the random person

41
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,950
plus the string "is going to buy lunch today."

42
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,640
!

43
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,080
Now, remember to add the space between the random person's name and the rest of the sentence.

44
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,660
And now we've completed the challenge and we're ready to check our solution and all going well, it

45
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,250
should work.

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,410
And if you run this through Repl.it or through the Chrome snippets tool, you should be able to see that each

47
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,020
time you run this code and you pass in a different array or the same array, it should give you a random

48
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,250
name from that list.
