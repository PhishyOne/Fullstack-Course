00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,600
All right, guys, in the next lesson, I've got a leap year coding challenge for you, and this is

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,840
a really interesting challenge. Although it is a little bit challenging, but it's really cool because

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,900
have you ever wondered what makes a particular year a leap year and what makes another year, not a

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,460
leap year?

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,510
And it's easy enough to say that every four years it's a leap year.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,000
But if you just got given a random year and you had to work out if it was a leap year, then there's

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
actually rules that you can follow to figure this out.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:42,360
So the rules are that on every year that is evenly divisible by 4, is a leap year, except every

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,820
year that is evenly divisible by 100.

10
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:52,710
So it's so if it's divisible by 4, but it's divisible by 100, then it's not a leap year unless

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,690
that year is also evenly divisible by 400.

12
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,850
So the rules are a little bit complex, but it might be easier if you look through some of the examples.

13
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,450
So, for example, if we wanted to figure out whether if year 2000 is a leap year, 2000 divide by four

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,460
divides cleanly, 500 with no remainder

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,550
so it's a leap year. When we divide 2000 by 100, then it's 20

16
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,260
so it also divides cleanly.

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,170
So it's actually now not a leap year.

18
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,360
But, but, but, 2000 divide by 400 equals 5 with no remainder

19
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,630
so finally, it actually is a leap year.

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,950
And you can look through the different examples and also  if you scroll down, you can

21
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,100
take a look at this website of known leap years and they show you step by step each of the rules that

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,330
we talked through just now.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,370
And you can test different years, such as the year 2000.

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,880
And you can see it step by step to see how they figured out whether if it is a leap year or not.

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:02,520
Now, I also recommend actually watching this video that I linked to up at the top

26
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,639
if you're not familiar with the concept of leap years. And even if you do understand leap years, it's

27
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,940
still a fantastic video to really understand how we're adjusting for a mismatch in the Earth's rotation

28
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,470
with the seasons.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,800
So I recommend taking a look at the video, reading through each of these statements and taking a look

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,680
at the known leap years and the website that it links to, and then to start thinking about how you

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,120
would write this logic.

32
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,890
Now, in order to map out the logic, I recommend creating a flow chart of your own on draw.io and to

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,010
use the flow chart to see how your code should flow.

34
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,970
Now, if you want a little bit of extra help, I'm about to reveal the flow chart that I've created.

35
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,580
If you want to first try to create your own and see if you get it right, then pause the video now.

36
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,050
All right.

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,460
So let's take a look at the flow chart that I created.

38
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,760
If you click on this link in hint #3, you'll be taken to a page that looks like this.

39
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,040
And so if we map out those rules and we click start, we see is it clearly divisible by four?

40
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,420
If no, then it's definitely not a leap year.

41
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,450
But if it is, then we have to check the next thing.

42
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,930
Is it cleanly divisible by 100?

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,900
No.

44
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,630
Well, then it's definitely a leap year.

45
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,430
But if it's yes, then we have to check the final thing.

46
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,220
Is it cleanly divisible by 400?

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,150
If yes, then it's a leap year.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,120
If no, it's not a leap year.

49
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,880
And that flow chart basically translates these three lines of logic.

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,380
Now, if English is not your first language, then I recommend to take a look at the flow chart and

51
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,040
also take a look at the rules for a leap year in your own language.

52
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,400
But once you're happy that you understand what's going on, then it's time to tackle the challenge and

53
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
write your code.

54
00:03:51,810 --> 00:04:00,210
Now, remember, you have to output exactly the words 'Leap year.' or 'Not leap year.'

55
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,010
and look at the capitalization and where the spaces and full stops go.

56
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,310
That way, when you check solution, you'll actually be able to pass your code if everything is correct.

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,490
So head over to the next lesson and tackle this challenge now.
