1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:08,300
Now we've already used some CSS properties in order to apply CSS to our different HTML elements, but in

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,220
this section we're going to do a deep dive into some of the most important CSS properties that you'll

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,690
see and use.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,300
And we're going to start with CSS, color properties. Some of the color properties you've already seen

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,410
previously.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:28,640
I've shown you how you can set the background color of a particular HTML element by using the background-color

7
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,800
property,

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,920
and previously we've been setting it to basic colors like red or blue or green.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,080
And remember that the way that the CSS rules work is the first part is the property.

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,850
And the part that comes after the colon is the value that you want to set that property to.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,630
So in this case, we're setting the background color of the HTML element, which remember contains everything

12
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,660
on our website,

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,769
so the entire web page to a color of red.

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,510
That's what that rule does.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,170
Now, there are different types of color properties.

16
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,090
There's the background color, but you can also simply use the color property,

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,080
and what this does is it sets the text color.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,900
So always check the MDN Docs

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,200
if you're not sure which property does what.

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:32,460
Notice that in this case, we've got two colors, which we've named red and blue,

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,640
well, how do we know that we can use these colors

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,380
and what exactly are they?

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,810
Well, they're called named colors.

24
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:47,910
And there's a whole bunch of them out there with poetic names like Cornflower Blue or Cadet Blue or

25
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,390
Dim Gray or Olive Drab, etcetera.

26
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,340
And you can find all of them by, of course, going to the Developer Documentation.

27
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,140
If you Google for MDN Docs named color, the first link should take you to this web page.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,580
Alternatively, you can use this URL as well, and the syntax is pretty simple

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,080
you simply use the name of the color and if you scroll through this table you'll see all the different

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,740
colors.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,880
And don't worry too much about the CSS Level 1 or Level 2 or Level 3,

32
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,870
it just describes historically when each color was introduced.

33
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,330
So these were introduced first because it's basically the rainbow.

34
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:35,650
And then over time we got some more fun colors like cyan and dark khaki and all of these different colors.

35
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:42,490
So you can simply copy the name of the color and paste it into your code and you'll be able to see that

36
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,380
rendered in your website.

37
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,900
Of course, even though there's many colors available in the default CSS named colors,

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,460
But you still sometimes might want to have a more unique color palette.

39
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,410
So what do you do in that case?

40
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,510
Well, one of my favorite color palettes is colorhunt.co.

41
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:09,070
It's a free tool that's created by designers for designers and of course, for us as well.

42
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,610
Here you've got professionally designed color palettes for colors stacked together that would look perfect

43
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,840
on any website.

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,450
You can imagine that if you select any of these random websites, maybe this could be the background

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,500
color of the website.

46
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,090
This could be an h1 color, this could be a subtitle or h2 color.

47
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,310
You have accent tones, you have main tones, and you can use all of these colors in your website.

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,110
But how do we use them if we don't have a name that's attached to it?

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,960
Instead, we've got all these numbers and letters,

50
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,730
what exactly are these?

51
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:51,820
Well, these are "hex codes" and they are a way of representing a larger number code for that particular

52
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,450
color.

53
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:00,010
So, for example, in this case, this is a color purple which is formed of three fractions, red,

54
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,030
green and blue.

55
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,720
And these are colors out of 255.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:15,160
So if you imagine a fraction, 93 out of 255 red, 56 out of 255 green 145 out of 255 blue.

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,160
And when you mix all three of these primary colors, you can get so many different types of shades.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,550
So in this case, we've got 93, 56, 145,

59
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:37,300
so 93 out of 255, 56 green out of 255 and 145.

60
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,860
So a little bit more blue and we end up with exactly the same shade as this purple you see right here

61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,480
Converting that RGB into a hex code,

62
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,600
so a different way of representing that number,

63
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,210
we get this particular hex code.

64
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,860
What does this mean for you?

65
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,780
Well, when you're using something like Color Hunt and you want to apply these different colors to your

66
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,080
website, you can simply copy the hex code and use it instead of the name.

67
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,770
And even on the MDN Docs for the named colors, you can see their hex codes lined up next to the names,

68
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,220
and in code it looks pretty much exactly the same.

69
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,860
Instead of the name, you just put the hex code.

70
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,650
So now it's time to try an exercise.

71
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,730
Go ahead and download this zip file from this current lesson, extract it and open it inside VS Code.

72
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,970
Once you're here, you should see it's a pretty simple website with just two elements inside the body,

73
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,950
a h1 and a h2.

74
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,740
And if we look at the preview, then you can see it's clearly a drab, black and white world.

75
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,370
We're going to change all of that by adding in CSS colors.

76
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,610
So you've got five steps that you need to complete here and you should follow them one by one and by

77
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,010
the end of all five steps, you should have a website that looks something like this with lots of different

78
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,980
colors and different background colors as well.

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,980
Pause the video now and give this challenge a go.

80
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,040
All right.

81
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,500
So let's walk through the solution together.

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,330
We've got the background-color of the body, which is set to antiquewhite, which is this color right

83
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,890
here.

84
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,400
And we've got the text color of the h1 set to white-smoke,

85
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,430
but you can also set the background color of the h1.

86
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:35,390
It's a property that's available on any of the elements and it simply takes the existing area of that

87
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,700
element and colors the background.

88
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,870
Now, that might have required a little bit of lateral thinking, but hopefully you got there in the

89
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,440
end.

90
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,910
And notice how in the h1 we've got all named colors and in the h2, I've asked you to use hex

91
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,760
colors and this is just so that you have practice adding colors using the two different methods.

92
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,280
Hopefully you got there in the end.

93
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,090
Once you're ready, head over to the next lesson and let's learn more about formatting fonts using CSS.
