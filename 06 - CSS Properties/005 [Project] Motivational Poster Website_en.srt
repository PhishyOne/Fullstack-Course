1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,680
All right.

2
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,070
So for the final project, we're going to be building a motivational poster website and we're going

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:09,000
to make our own memes.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,880
You might have seen some of these around the Internet.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,780
There are the serious ones which are based off these '90s seconds motivational posters where you have

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,280
some sort of title and you have some sort of motivational text like, "POTENTIAL."

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,620
"We all have the tools for greatness within us," and I believe that is true,

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,650
and you've got a cute little Arctic fox.

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,510
But also there are some pretty hilarious ones like "COOLNESS."

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,410
"You may be cool...but you'll never be 4 popped-collars

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,850
cool," like this guy.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,850
So the goal is to make our own website where we can create our own motivational poster.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,090
The important part of a motivational poster is there is an image that is going to be big,

14
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,870
there is a border around the image,

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,970
so we now know all about borders and we can do that.

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:04,690
We have a black background and that is easy because we know all about CSS color properties.

17
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:13,560
We have a big main title, which we're going to use a custom font for to mimic this font a little bit

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,250
better.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,910
And finally, we have a paragraph at the bottom. And we're going to figure out how we're going to center

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:26,850
things on the screen, how to add borders and how to apply basically everything that we've learned so

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,260
far in this section.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:35,520
Go ahead and download the starting project files for the Motivation Meme Project and extract it and

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,100
then open it up inside VS Code.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,190
I've created the task in a sort of to do list breakdown for you.

25
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,740
Now the main thing is that it's your website, it's your project, and as with all the projects in the

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,920
course, it's totally up to you how you want to create it.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,100
But there are some caveats and it's important that you touch all of the learning points.

28
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,690
So these six points are important, and after completing these six points, you can change your website,

29
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,120
you can mess with it however you like, but want to make sure that everything you've learned so far

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,150
has consolidated and it all makes sense.

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:23,040
We're going to use a custom font from Google called The Libre Baskerville, which looks somewhat similar

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,550
to the motivational main title font.

33
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,850
You should add your own image into the images folder under the assets folder.

34
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,760
I've got an example image in here for you just in case you want to use it, but I recommend putting

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,190
in your own images just for practice.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:50,280
And that image should have a 5px white border and the text should be center-aligned and you should

37
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,060
adjust the margin so that the image and text are centered on the page.

38
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,050
Now, this is going to be the trickiest part because centering elements using CSS is a whole science

39
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,450
in itself, but we're going to do it simply.

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,990
We're going to horizontally center the div by giving that div a width of 50% to take up 50% of the screen,

41
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,620
and then if you think about it, there's only 25% left on each side.

42
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,770
So if we have a margin-left of 20% on that div, then it should push it into the center.

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,680
In addition, you might find it useful to set the image to have a width of 100% so that it fills the

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,660
entire container div so that you're not having to center the image along with the div.

45
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,670
Some of these hints are only going to make sense once you get started writing the code for it, so don't

46
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,540
worry too much about it

47
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,030
now, I'm just highlighting certain points in the TODO so that when you get to it, to pay more attention

48
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,100
to these parts and these helpful tips, which you'll probably need because especially at this point,

49
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,860
number five, it's quite a difficult task and it will take some time for you to figure out how to get

50
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,630
it to look like this.

51
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:02,850
And if you want to push the div down vertically, then I recommend just adding a top-margin to push

52
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,770
it down by a pixel amount.

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,590
It doesn't have to be spot bang in the middle of the center because as I said, that is a whole science

54
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,750
in itself and we're going to be covering it in coming sections, but it's just a little bit more complicated.

55
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,269
So we're going to judge it by eye for this project for now. In order to get something that looks like

56
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:29,340
the goal image, I recommend putting the h1, the paragraph, and the image inside a div.

57
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,300
That way you can center the div on the screen and you won't have to mess with all three elements and

58
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,330
their centering, which is already a hard enough task.

59
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:49,710
Finally, you're going to use your Developer doc reading skills and learn by yourself about a property

60
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:58,140
called text-transform and figure out how to make the h1 look uppercase like what I've got in the solution

61
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,640
goal website.

62
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,900
All of these elements are on screen.

63
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:07,660
We've got the white board around the image, we've got the black background, the white text, the custom

64
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,520
font and our h1 is totally in uppercase without us having to type it in uppercase.

65
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,730
So that's where that text-transform property comes in.

66
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:25,510
And notice how this entire content div is roughly somewhere in the center, horizontally and vertically,

67
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,800
just judging it by eye.

68
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,100
It's not perfect, but as long as you find the perfect avocado, everything else is easy in life.

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,420
Pause the video now and complete this project and once you're done, come back and I'm going to walk

70
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,980
through the solution code with you.

71
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,140
All right.

72
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,290
So hopefully that wasn't too hard.

73
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:56,570
If we take a look at the solution HTML, you can see that I've completed all of those tasks with a small

74
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,010
HTML and a small CSS file, so it shouldn't be too hard.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,650
Now, some of the steps are pretty self-explanatory, but there's a couple of things I want to just

76
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,750
briefly touch on.

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:17,930
One is you will need the Google font links in the head section if you want to be able to have that custom

78
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,520
font on screen.

79
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,530
And this is the custom font.

80
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,600
In addition, we want to have all our elements inside a div so that we can style it all together.

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,090
And that's quite important in terms of positioning.

82
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,550
So I've created a class for the div.

83
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,450
In this case, you could have also used an ID, but if you were going to extend this website then it's

84
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,920
safer to use a class

85
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,380
so that you might be able to reuse the CSS in the future.

86
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,570
The poster is the part that is more or less center aligned and we use that trick with setting its width

87
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,670
and setting its margin, using percentages to get it more or less in the horizontal center.

88
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,580
And then I simply set a 100px margin-top, just judging it by eye to get it somewhere in the middle.

89
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:16,200
And I added the custom font and the border to the image and made the image 100% wide so that it would

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,840
fit fully into that poster div. If you had any problems

91
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,910
this is a time where you can look at the solution code and look at your own code and see if there's

92
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,860
any fixes you want to make.

93
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,850
And once you have, then you can also modify the website any way you like to personalize it and make

94
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,720
it your own.
