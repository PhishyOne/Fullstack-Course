00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,660
Hey guys. In this lesson I'm going to be taking you on a walkthrough for how to setup your local environment

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,510
for developing React apps on a Mac computer.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,390
Up until now we've been using code sandbox which is a browser based tool to create our React apps.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,030
And it's really nice being able to have your development environment wherever you are and which ever

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,350
computer you log into

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,510
as long as you head over to code sandbox you'll have the same projects always up and running with you.

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,530
But if you want to set up your local environment to use a code editor that you prefer

8
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,270
say Atom or VS code or Sublime or whatever it may be so that you can start creating React apps on

9
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,890
your local system,

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,220
then this lesson is for you.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,470
There's four steps that are required to do this.

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,380
First we have to check that our Node version is up to date. Depending on when you completed the Node

13
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,870
module of the course,

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,780
it might be that you need to update your Node version.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,320
Now if you are coming to the React module without having done the Node module in the curriculum I strongly

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,260
strongly recommend to do the Node module first because there's a lot of concepts that are covered there

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,560
that we're not going to go through again because we've already gone through it in excruciating detail.

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,350
I really strongly recommend to complete the Node module first before you tackle React. This way

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,330
things will actually make more sense and will be much easier to work with it.

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,000
The first thing we have to do is to check that we're running the latest version of Node, so head over

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,240
nodejs.org and over here on the left hand side you'll see the version of Node that is currently

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,300
stable.

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:50,100
If you go ahead and open up your hyper terminal and type in node --version and then hit enter,

24
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,250
you'll see your current version of Node that you're running on your computer.

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,820
And mine is currently version 12.13.0 which happens to be the most up to date

26
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,210
version of Node.

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,630
Now if you're seeing a lower version or if you're seeing something like node command doesn't exist, then

28
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,000
it might just be because you haven't installed Node or you haven't installed the latest version.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,860
So go ahead and simply just click on this button and go through the wizard to install the latest version

30
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,150
of Node.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,880
And once you're done then go back into your hyper terminal and check that you've got the latest version

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,390
like what we've done just now.

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,710
Now if you don't know what the hyper terminal is, we've already gone through this in the command line

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,980
module and I've talked about a lot of these commands like changing directory and instructing your computer

35
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,750
to do certain things and we're going to be using the command line quite a lot.

36
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,490
So the command line module is definitely essential knowledge and I recommend completing it before you

37
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,630
proceed any further.

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,960
Now in your command line, you might see a dollar sign as a prompt instead of my percentage symbol.

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,980
And the reason why I'm seeing a percentage symbol is because the shell that I'm running is currently

40
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,600
zsh.

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:14,900
So on the latest version of MacOS Catalina, Apple decided that they wanted us to use the zsh terminal

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,650
instead of the bash terminal.

43
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,000
So if you updated to Catalina you might also see an error message asking you to switch over to the z

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,430
sh terminal in which case just follow the advice that they've given and paste in the command they've

45
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,570
specified.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,690
So now that we've checked that on Node version is up to date,

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,020
step two is to install VS code.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,040
Now I prefer using VS code when I'm developing React apps because it has a lot of extensions that make

49
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,990
it really easy to work with React apps.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,310
Now this is totally a personal preference.

51
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:56,330
So if you prefer working with Atom or Sublime or any other code editor in fact, you can use all of them to

52
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,700
develop for React.

53
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,200
But if you have no preference or you want to try something new, then I recommend heading over to code

54
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,630
.visualstudio.com and download this free open source code

55
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,110
editor

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,200
that's from Microsoft.

57
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,400
So if you click on this button you'll be guided through the wizard.

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,100
And once you've installed that it should open up and have some welcome messages et cetera.

59
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,930
But it will look quite similar actually in terms of the user interface to the code sandbox that we've

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,370
been using.

61
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,340
Now it doesn't matter which editor you choose but I recommend to head over to this link which I'll include

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,720
in the course resources and find your code editor to install the syntax highlighter to be able to work

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
with React much more easily.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,130
So for Atom, the package is called language-Babel. For Visual Studio code

65
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,990
it's called sublime-babel and it's by a guy called Josh Peng.

66
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,570
If we head over to VS code and we go to the extensions tab and we search for sublime babel, you can

67
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,110
see this is the package that we want.

68
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,430
So go ahead and click install to add it to your VS code.

69
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,590
And this just gives it the capability to be able to highlight your JSX code and your React code

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
much easier.

71
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,870
Now another thing that I recommend installing is the VS code icons package.

72
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:28,860
And what this does is it just simply adds on these icon images to the files which have different extensions.

73
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:31,780
And it has a different image for each file extension.

74
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,270
It just makes it much easier to identify what's actually going on in terms of the file structure you've

75
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:38,630
got.

76
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:45,230
Because with React we're mixing a lot of different types of files right? JSX and JS and CSS and 

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,270
HTML.

78
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,370
So I find that really helpful as well. So hopefully now you've completed step 1 and step 2.

79
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:59,940
And remember that step 2 is just to have some sort of local editor and to add the syntax highlighting

80
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,390
packages that were specified in the link.

81
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:12,090
Now step three is to actually create a React app. And I'm going to refer you to a documentation on the

82
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,260
React website which tells us how we should do this.

83
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:23,730
They've created a tool that allows us to easily build a React app from scratch and all we have to do

84
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:33,000
is to use npx which is a package runner tool for npm and we use a package called create-react-app to

85
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,780
create an app called my-app or whatever else you might want to name it.

86
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,460
As long as we've got our Node version up to date we can simply just highlight this line of code, copy

87
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,400
it and head into our hyper terminal and paste it in.

88
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,540
And it doesn't matter where you are, which directory you're in,

89
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:58,110
this will act globally so you can just paste it in and hit enter. And it's gonna get started creating

90
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,760
a app called my-app and it's going to install the required packages which is react, react-dom which we've

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,500
really seen and used and something called react-scripts. Now react

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:17,490
-scripts is a module that's going to help us run our React app locally and serve it up in our browser.

93
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,630
And we're going to see it in action very soon.

94
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:27,720
So this process of installing create-react-app and creating a new app can take anywhere between two

95
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,090
to five minutes depending on your machine.

96
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,890
So for me the longest it's been about 10 minutes and the shortest was about 2.

97
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,940
So be patient,

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,460
grab a cup of tea and come back once it's done.

99
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:46,280
Once this process has completed, it will give you a success message and it'll tell you where it's created

100
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,870
your app.

101
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,030
So in my case it's created in my root directory and then users and then angela and then my-app.

102
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,670
So the way that they tell you to start the server and run the app is to cd over to the location of

103
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,870
your newly created app and then run npm start.

104
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,040
Let's go ahead and do that.

105
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:13,610
Let's put in cd and our location, so you can simply just copy this if you want and paste it in here,

106
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,170
and then hit enter.

107
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:23,090
And now notice how we're inside our my-app project directory where we can run the command npm start.

108
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:29,720
And this is gonna use that react-scripts module in order to start the development server. And you're

109
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,020
probably gonna get a pop up from Apple telling you that your terminal is trying to control Google Chrome

110
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,000
and that's exactly what we want it to do.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,440
So go ahead and click okay and it will open up your React app that you've just built from scratch into

112
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,290
localhost 3000. And this is the current file as it is. Now if we want it to show something

113
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,180
else then we're gonna have to edit our src/App.js file.

114
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,660
So if you go back into Visual Studio code and add the folder that we've just created, in my case it was

115
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:10,160
under my root folder under users under my username and then the folder was called my-app, so select this

116
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,750
folder that you've just created and then go ahead and click add.

117
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,700
And that's going to add the entire project into VS code.

118
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,650
Now if you expand the public and source folder which you should already be getting pretty used to because

119
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:29,910
we've been using that in our code sandboxes when we've been creating our React apps so far.

120
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,160
But notice how React has added a bunch of templates and images and files that we don't really need and

121
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,120
it's just kind of cluttering up our project.

122
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:46,910
So what I want you to do is to go ahead and select all of these files except the index.html,

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,920
so the public folder should only have our index.html file and then go ahead and right click

124
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,530
on the rest of them and just delete them and send them to trash. And then in our source the only file

125
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,310
you want is the index.js file.

126
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,250
And we're going to delete everything else and send that to trash as well.

127
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,470
So now we're left with a structure that we should be pretty familiar with.

128
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,040
We've got our index.html and our index.js.

129
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:21,160
So let's go ahead and reformat some of these code files so that it actually makes more sense to us.

130
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,580
A lot of these things such as the favicon or the theme color, this is all the stuff that we don't actually

131
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,390
need.

132
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:38,480
So inside the head tag, I want you to go ahead and delete everything other than the title. And inside the

133
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
body I want you to delete everything

134
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,360
other than that very important root div.

135
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,850
And if you've accidentally delete it then just put it back in.

136
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,830
So remember whenever we create React apps, the app is always going to be inserted into a root div.

137
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,690
Now we want to go ahead and link to our index.js file at the end of our body.

138
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:07,580
So let's go ahead and create a script tag and let's give it a source that's equal to ./

139
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:14,440
so a relative path to the source folder, and then it's the index.js file that we want.

140
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:22,160
Now while I'm here, I'm also going to add that type attribute to say that this is a text/jsx

141
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,070
file so that we don't get any errors in the console.

142
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:32,870
Now I'm done editing my HTML and it should be pretty plain and pretty easy to understand now and I'm

143
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,510
going to go into my index.js and I'm going to delete everything other than my top two imports

144
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,370
which we are already really familiar with importing React from the react module, importing ReactDOM

145
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:52,100
from the react-dom module. And then all I'm going to do is try to render a h1 onto my screen. So

146
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,810
I'm gonna use my ReactDOM's render method. This is all pretty familiar to you.

147
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,430
And we're going to render a single h1 that just says "Hello World" and we're going to place it in

148
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:11,430
our document.getElementById and it's going to be in the div with id of root.

149
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:18,560
So now that we've done this, let's go ahead and hit save on all of these files and head back over to

150
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,020
our browser, our localhost 3000 and you'll see it update with our React app.

151
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,990
So from this point on, you should be pretty familiar because it's exactly the same as what we've done

152
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,540
in our code sandbox and you know how to do things that are a lot fancier than this but this is just

153
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,570
an example of how you can create React apps locally on your computer without the use of code sandbox.

154
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,920
If you get stuck at any point along the way,

155
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,750
I recommend checking out the React support page because there's a lot of discussion forums especially

156
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:57,410
the React flux online chat which is on discord which has a lot of helpful people who are really really

157
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,510
knowledgeable and they can help you if you get stuck along the way installing React or trying to get

158
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,910
it to work on your local system.

159
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,220
Now in the coming lessons, we're going to be building out our Google keeper app and I'm going to be doing

160
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,560
it on code sandbox so that it's easy to share the links to the sandboxes with you guys.

161
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,550
But if you prefer working on it locally, then you now know how to create a new React app and how to run

162
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,330
it in the browser locally.

163
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,290
So the choice is yours which ever way makes you happy is the way that you should choose.

164
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,460
Once you're done and once you already set up in the next lesson we're going to get started building

165
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,860
out the first part of our keeper app. So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
