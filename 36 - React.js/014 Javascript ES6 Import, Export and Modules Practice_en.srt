00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,780
Alright guys, it's time to put into practice what you learned in the last lesson, namely how to use

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,960
these import and export keywords and how to work with different files and different modules.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,270
In this challenge, I want you to import the functions that live in this calculator.js file and

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:28,160
once you've imported it, it's going to be used in each of these lis to calculate a number to go on

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,500
to the website.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,660
Now the results that you're aiming for is the same as this Final.png file. Four bullet points each

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,310
with a number which is calculated from each of these methods.

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,420
And all you need to do is figure out how to import those methods so that they can be used inside our

9
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,860
EJS here.

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,250
Now when you start out, you're going to get a lot of errors and a lot of warnings. Things like add is

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,400
not defined, multiply's not defined. It basically doesn't know any of these methods until you actually

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,440
figure out the code and import the correct functions.

13
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,230
So go ahead and fork this sandbox and try to solve this challenge.

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,520
And once you're done we can walk through it together.

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,310
All right.

16
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:18,870
So the first thing we're going to do is go into our calculator.js because we need to export all

17
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,470
of the functions that we want to be accessible from other files.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,980
So in this case I have no default thing that I want to export. I actually want to export all of these

19
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,180
functions separately.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:38,020
So I'm going to add the add function, the multiply, subtract and divide.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,700
Now remember that at this stage you don't want to add any parentheses to these functions.

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,890
We're just exporting the function as it is without activating or calling it. Once I've exported all of

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,670
these functions

24
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,540
I can now go back to my index.js and I can import all of the ones that I want from that file.

25
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,930
So at this stage I've got two options really. I could either use a wildcard form where I input everything

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:13,140
packaged under one name, or I can import each of them separately. So I can go ahead and say add, subtract,

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,450
multiply and divide.

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,500
Now notice the order in which you import these methods don't have to be the same as the order that you

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,550
export it

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:33,450
as long as the names match precisely, so like what I've got here. Now next I have to specify where or which

31
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,820
file I'm importing from.

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,580
And in my case I'm gonna use a relative path to my calculator.js file.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:48,510
So now that we've imported all of these functions our errors have gone away and our website is now working

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,780
and looking exactly the same as what we've got in the sample, the final.png.

35
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,930
This is one way of solving it.

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,750
Another way that you could have done this is to use the wildcard

37
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,320
right?

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,500
So you could've added an asterix and you could've given that particular module a name, so we could call it

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,480
calculator.

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,480
And then down here instead of just writing add or multiply, what we have to do instead is we have to

41
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,670
add calculator.add, because this calculator is the object and it contains a whole bunch of functions

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,110
that corresponds to the ones that we exported.

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,200
So now I could add calculator.add or .multiplied, .subtract and .divide.

44
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,960
And this now works perfectly as well.

45
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,910
So you have lots and lots of options and it's important that you understand that both of these methods

46
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,530
work so that when you come across them in the wild you won't be confused and you'll understand what

47
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,820
it does.

48
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,340
So have a play around with this file if there's anything that you're still unsure about. And once

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,770
you're already come and join us back on the next lesson where we're going to learn about how to set up

50
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,180
our local environment for React development.

51
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,650
So for all of that and more, I'll see there.
