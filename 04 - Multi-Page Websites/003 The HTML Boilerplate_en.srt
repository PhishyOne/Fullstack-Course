1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,370
Now that we've seen how HTML elements and tags work, it's time to explore the bigger picture, what's

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,430
called the HTML Boilerplate.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,880
And this will allow us to understand the structure of our HTML files just like how there is structure

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,380
to letters that you would write.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,030
For example, there's the section where you have your address and then you probably would include a

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,810
dear so and so, and then you have the body of your letter and finally you would write something like

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,660
yours sincerely and then your name and signature.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,760
Similarly, there is a structure to our HTML files and it looks something like this.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,500
And this is called a Boilerplate.

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,510
It's what you usually start off with when you create any new HTML file.

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,050
And we're going to go through it line by line so that we understand it.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,300
At the top of every HTML file, there should be a "Doctype declaration."

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,530
And that's what this tag does.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,610
It tells the browser which version of HTML the file was written in.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:15,570
Now the latest version of HTML is HTML5 and the Doctype declaration looks like this with an angle bracket (<),

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,310
an exclamation mark(!), DOCTYPE in all caps and then html.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,850
And this line tells any browser that's reading our HTML file that we have written our code in HTML Version

18
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,480
5.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,120
The next part that we've got is the actual "html".

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,440
Now, this is going to be the "root" of the document.

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,310
It means that everything else, every other element, no matter if it's an h1 or an image or a link,

22
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:52,440
it's all going to go inside the opening and closing tags of the html element. And this attribute where

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,380
it says "lang," this is the language of the text content in that element.

24
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,160
So for example, if you're writing a website that is going to be targeted at English speakers, then

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,920
you're going to set your lang to English,

26
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,550
"en".

27
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,380
Now this isn't very important for the users who can see your website,

28
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:20,370
it's more important for the users who can't, because there are various screen readers and assistive technologies

29
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,770
that will look at this language attribute so that when they read out the website, they can pronounce

30
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,000
the words correctly.

31
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,220
"Opens profile photo. Follow @yu_angela.

32
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,590
Button."

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,870
Now, with the HTML element, we're starting to see the beginnings of a hamburger.

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,810
There's a bun at the top and there's a bun at the bottom.

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,180
For those of you guys who have been my longterm friends, you know how much I love food analogies,

36
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,570
but this is a great one because when we have an html element, usually there is the opening and the

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,920
closing and everything that belongs in it is sandwiched inside.

38
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,600
Now the next part of the HTML boilerplate is the "head element".

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:07,590
And this is an area where important information about our website is placed that is not going to be

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,450
displayed to the user.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,450
It includes things that will help the website render in the browser correctly, but it doesn't include

42
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,940
any sort of content like text or images or anything that the user will see.

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,180
So one of the things that you should always have in the Head Section is a "meta" tag for the character

44
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,280
set encoding of the web page, and in this case, it's set as "UTF-8".

45
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:40,110
What this does is it ensures that the characters that you're using on your website gets displayed correctly.

46
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,410
So, for example, in certain character sets, it won't allow emojis to render, in other character sets

47
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,580
they won't have certain symbols like multiplication and division symbols,

48
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,210
and that's what this "meta" tag takes care of.

49
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,740
Usually by convention in our HTML boilerplate, we will simply just include this tag as is using the

50
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,310
"UTF-8" character set, which is one of the most common.

51
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,260
So you don't even have to think about it.

52
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,340
Now another thing that you should have in your Head Section is the "title" of your website, and that

53
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,519
title is usually what gets displayed up here in the tab bar.

54
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:28,380
And in fact, if you right-click on any website in Chrome, you can click to "View Page Source" and you

55
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,580
can see we've got our DOCTYPE, we've got our html element, inside it, we've got our head, our character

56
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,120
set.

57
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,240
And then if we scroll a little bit more, you can see we've got our title here.

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,840
And in between the opening and closing tags of the title, it tells you what title should be displayed

59
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,710
up here.

60
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,150
So in our case here, the title will simply say, "My Website."

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,880
Now, there's a lot more things that can go into the head element, as you've seen when we looked at

62
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,520
the Google home page,

63
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:09,050
but for now, these two are the most important things that will always go into your HTML files

64
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,700
and it's important to know.

65
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,490
We'll cover other tags as we come across them.

66
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Now, the next sandwich inside the sandwich, if you will, are two slices of tomatoes.

67
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,990
No, just kidding.

68
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,000
It's actually the "body element."

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,140
Just like a person.

70
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,600
After the head element comes the "body" element.

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,920
Inside the body element is where we're going to be spending the majority of our time creating and writing

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,030
our website.

73
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,530
This is where all of the content of the website goes.

74
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,090
So the text, the titles, the images, the links, everything that you can do with HTML,

75
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:53,180
creating content and structure goes in between the opening and the closing tags of the body element.

76
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,510
So somewhere inside here.

77
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,580
Now what can go in here?

78
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:06,660
Well, we've seen already how an h1 works so we can put in a heading, we can add images, we can add

79
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,380
lots of things,

80
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,680
and this is essentially where the meat of our website is going to live.

81
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,300
Once our burger collapses down, you can see that this is what a typical website's HTML code is made

82
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,990
up of.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,490
So no matter what you add into your body, you can vary it up.

84
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,430
But by default, most websites will start off with a boilerplate that looks like this.

85
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,450
When you're starting out, I often recommend students to type this out when they're creating new websites

86
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:47,640
and in fact you can have a go doing this now by going into VS Code, typing out these elements and creating

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,400
your website entirely from scratch.

88
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:57,900
Now, we're beginning to see this idea of nesting in an HTML document, and this is going to be a concept

89
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,970
that's going to become super important as we learn more and more programming,

90
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,850
but it's simple to understand if we come back to this analogy of the hamburger.

91
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,150
So we have our HTML element which has the opening and closing tags here, and it is exactly like our

92
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,410
hamburger bun.

93
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:26,220
So this is our top bun and this is our bottom bun, and sandwich

94
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,510
in between is everything that goes inside the HTML element.

95
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:38,040
Now, if we take a look at our body element, then you can see here we've got the opening body tag,

96
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:43,500
which will represent with a slice of tomato and the closing body tag,

97
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,570
and in between those two slices of tomato is the content for our website.

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,890
Now, you'll notice that some of the HTML tags, even though they have an opening and closing tag, they're

99
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,380
not on different lines.

100
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,380
And that's because if we can fit it on one line and we can see the beginning and the end very easily,

101
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,230
then we don't actually need to create several lines,

102
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,040
but nonetheless, it still got a beginning and an end.

103
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,280
Now the important thing for us when we're writing code and we've got all of this sandwiching going on

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:25,680
that we indent our code properly so that you can see that this clearly lines up with the opening tag

105
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,040
here.

106
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,640
So they are clearly sandwiching something in between.

107
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,650
And then we have two spaces and we've got the next indentation level here.

108
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:43,320
So this one lines up with the closing tag and through this kind of indentation you can quite easily

109
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:52,610
visualize that this Head Section is clearly embedded inside the html section.

110
00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,840
So just like our lettuce is inside our hamburger, by indenting our code properly, we'll be able to

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,180
keep our code tidy and we'll be able to see at a glance exactly what our code looks like.

112
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,510
Now, finally, because we're using VS Code, I want to tell you about a shortcut,

113
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,580
that means you don't have to type out this boilerplate every single time.

114
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,800
Once you've typed it out once or twice and you know exactly how this boilerplate looks, you can save

115
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,760
a lot of time by simply typing exclamation mark (!),

116
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:33,810
hitting Enter on the first selection and then it will automatically insert all of that code for you,

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,060
saving you a lot of time, especially when you're creating many HTML documents.

118
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:47,580
Now, the important thing here, though, is this only works if you have created a dot HTML (.html) website.

119
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,880
So notice that when you create a new file inside VS Code, if you name it and save it as something something

120
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,460
dot html, then this trick will work.

121
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,450
If you save it with another extension, then it won't.

122
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,050
There's a couple of things here that we haven't seen before,

123
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,040
a couple more "meta tags" and there's a lot of other meta tags,

124
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:19,140
but here we've got one line here which says, http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE-edge".

125
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,690
This basically just keeps our code compatible with Internet Explorer.

126
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,150
And in fact, I normally don't write this line anymore because Internet Explorer has been deprecated,

127
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,270
and is no longer in use.

128
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,430
So if you want to keep your code clean, you can actually delete this from your VS Code autogenerated

129
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,210
boilerplate.

130
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:48,420
Now the next one tells you the "viewport," and it defines how the website should be displayed relative

131
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,840
to the screen that it's being rendered on.

132
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,990
And this line of code just tells the browser how to display your website when it first opens.

133
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,530
So now that we've learned all about HTML boilerplates, it's time to build your own boilerplate, or

134
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,570
in this case, build your own burger.

135
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,650
As you notice, there are endless numbers of HTML elements and we're going to be creating our own HTML

136
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,400
elements,

137
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:22,050
but the important thing here I want you to understand is how nesting works in HTML and how you can keep

138
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,510
your code tidy by using good indentation and keeping good programming practices.

139
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,450
If we're building our own imaginary burger, let's imagine the world's best burger,

140
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:38,820
you can have it vegan, you can have it vegetarian, you can have bacon, you can have whatever it is

141
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,950
your heart desires, but you have to write it in HTML code.

142
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,160
Let's begin by creating a bun.

143
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:56,010
So I've got a bun element that I've created which has an opening and a closing tag, and I've added

144
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,790
an attribute.

145
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,490
You can add as many of these attributes as you like.

146
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,780
And remember, we add attributes by giving it a name, and then after an equal sign, we give it a value.

147
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,260
Now the next part is for you to invent.

148
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,020
So head over to VS Code and build your own burger, adding in whatever elements you want.

149
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:24,780
Add tomatoes, add ham, but make sure that you're keeping the indentation correct and that you're working

150
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,220
with this idea of opening and closing tags.

151
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:36,660
But you can be as creative as you like, and be sure to share your code for your burger in the Q&A section.

152
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,700
And if you want some inspiration,

153
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:47,130
this is one that I made earlier, but I want you to practice making your own and doing it your way.

154
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,960
Have a go at that and once you're done, head over to the next lesson.
