1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,800
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,560
So now that you know all about file paths, we're going to use that important knowledge to help us build

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,870
multi-page websites.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,220
And we're going to be introducing you to this concept of web pages.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,410
If we think of the websites that we've created so far, it looks something like this.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,730
It's pretty simple.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,540
Normally we'll have a Project folder that contains the entire website, and inside there we'll have

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,090
our starting file, which is our index.html.

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,840
And this is where we've been writing all our code.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:40,010
Now there's other subsidiary files that we've had, like an Images folder with images or other folders.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,000
et cetera.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:48,000
But in order to create a multi-page website, what we'll need is multiple web pages, right?

13
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:53,910
So maybe we'll have an "About page"  that tells people who visit our website all about ourselves.

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,690
Maybe we'll have a "Contact Us page" so that people who visit our personal website, they can send us

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,820
an email or they can call us if we want them to.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,250
All of these web pages then go into the same project folder and it becomes our multi-page website and

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,350
it might look something like this.

18
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,090
We could have our index.html.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,950
We could have our about.html.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:26,040
We can have many, many others if we want to, but we have to refer to them in our anchor tags and using

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,820
our links in order for the user to be able to navigate to it.

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:38,880
If we're trying to show a link to the, "about page," on our "home page", which remember is our index.html,

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,080
then we can use what we learned about the file path in order to get there.

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,880
The path to take us to the "about page"

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,690
if we're creating this anchor tag inside the index.html would look something like this.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:02,210
We have our href which is set to ./, which remember means that we should look inside the current

27
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,190
directory.

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,630
So inside our Project folder.

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:14,510
And then we're going to go to a file called about.html, which takes us to this particular page.

30
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:21,230
And that means that when the user actually clicks on this link that links to the about page, then it

31
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,160
should go ahead and redirect to this web page.

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,310
And this is what it would look like if this anchor tag was rendered in a browser.

33
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:39,860
When you click on the link, then it redirects you to the about.html and then you end up seeing

34
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,550
this HTML page instead of the home page.

35
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:50,090
Now I've got a quiz for you and this is a little bit of revision on how file paths work.

36
00:02:50,210 --> 00:03:01,160
We are located currently within the index.html and we're trying to navigate all the way to this

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,120
cat.png.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,960
We want to show this image on our home page.

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,290
I've got four options for you here for how we would structure that image element.

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:20,750
What I want you to do is to take out your mobile phone, open up your camera, and for you to scan the

41
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,500
QR code of the solution that you think is correct.

42
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,670
If you don't know how to scan your QR code, it's super simple.

43
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,950
All you do is on Android,

44
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:38,330
simply open up the camera application and just point it at the QR code and the same thing in iPhone,

45
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,120
open up the camera application, choose the normal photo mode and then point it at the QR code.

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:55,080
And when you point it, it should show up the URL either here on Android or here on iOS and just simply

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,880
tap on it and you'll be taken to an animated gif that should tell you whether if you got it right or

48
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,890
if you got the answer wrong.

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:15,930
So let's go through the solution together one by one and see which one is correct.

50
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,070
Now, if you picked option one, then unfortunately this would have been the wrong answer.

51
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,370
And the reason is because the path starts off with two dots (..),

52
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,430
And what this means is to go into the previous directory.

53
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:41,220
This index.html is inside our Project folder and the double slash will go one level higher to this next

54
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,950
folder, right here.

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,570
Now, we don't actually want to go into that folder,

56
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,840
we want to go into the Project folder.

57
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,780
That's why this is wrong, unfortunately.

58
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,790
Now the next one is this one, and the reason why this one is also incorrect is because the image tag

59
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,970
uses an attribute called source, "src," and not the "href".

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,920
The href is only for the anchor tags and not for the image tag.

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,390
And because in this case we want to display our cat image, then this is also unfortunately wrong.

62
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,490
Now the third one I'm going to go through is here, so you'll probably know what the correct answer

63
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:24,820
is.

64
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,380
And the reason why this is wrong is because we have an anchor tag here

65
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,450
instead of an image tag.

66
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,830
An anchor tag will give us a link to a web page or a website or somewhere on the Internet, but it will

67
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,900
not display our image.

68
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,280
So this is also incorrect.

69
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:53,920
Finally, what we have is this one where we have an image element with a source (src) set to the correct file

70
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,300
path, which is the current directory using ./.

71
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,970
So that means go into the project folder.

72
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,190
That's what the ./ will do for us.

73
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:10,240
And then from there, navigate to the assets folder and then from there navigate into images and then

74
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,160
into cat.png.

75
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,780
So this is the correct answer.

76
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,140
Did you get it right?

77
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,910
If not, be sure to revise the section on file paths because this is a really important topic for the

78
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,430
up and coming lessons that we'll need to do.

79
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,940
But if you did get it right, then congratulations.

80
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,310
Well done on completing the quiz.

81
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:41,050
So now that you've seen how to create multi-page websites using file paths, then it's time to use this

82
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,540
knowledge in an exercise.

83
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:50,140
Go ahead and download the zip file from this current lesson and then go ahead and extract it and open

84
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,000
it inside VS Code.

85
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,360
Once you've got that extracted and open inside your Web Development Project, you should see a file

86
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,000
and folder structure that looks like this.

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,410
Let's go ahead and expand everything so I can explain what's going on here.

88
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:16,180
Here we've got our index.html located inside the 4.1 Webpages folder, and then we've also got some

89
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,340
image assets, this cat image, which is inside a folder called Images.

90
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,880
And this folder is inside a folder called Assets.

91
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,230
So it actually looks something like what we had previously, which is the assets folder, contains the

92
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,370
images folder, which contains the cat.png.

93
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,330
So just keep that in mind when you're working through it because on VS Code when a folder doesn't

94
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,840
actually contain any files, but it does contain other folders, it can display it like this, which

95
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,600
looks a little bit different from what you're used to.

96
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,770
The other aspect we've got here is our public folder here, and this public folder normally contains

97
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,420
all of the HTML files

98
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,640
that is not our home page.

99
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,180
So apart from our index.html, everything else usually gets organized into the same folder which is

100
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,430
called public.

101
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,450
Now, the challenge for you here is pretty simple.

102
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,340
If you take a look inside the goal.png, it'll show you how to see the challenge.

103
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,640
What I want you to do is to right-click on the solution.html file here and then go ahead and click

104
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,810
show preview.

105
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,809
Now what this is going to do is it's going to show you the preview of what you're trying to achieve

106
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:40,200
without showing you the solution code, which you will see if you click on this file.

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,610
So make sure you don't just click on it, but you right-click on it to see the preview.

108
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,910
Now, once you're here, you can see what we've got is an h1 that's already been created for you in

109
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,050
the starting code,

110
00:08:52,050 --> 00:09:00,720
and then the next part that I want you to do is to add an image of yourself that links to the "about

111
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,020
page".

112
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,180
So this is very important. Here

113
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,980
this is obviously not myself,

114
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,090
I could be a cat teaching you, but I am not.

115
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:15,820
But what I've done for this image is I've embedded it inside a link.

116
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,790
So when I click on this image, you can see it goes to the about.html page.

117
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,000
Now, if I go back, then I'll go back to my home page and at the very bottom here, I've got the second

118
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,210
challenge, which is add a link to your "Contact Me page."

119
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:37,570
So here, if you click on this link, then you should be taken to the contacts.html, which is inside

120
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,640
the public folder right here.

121
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,680
So these are your two web pages that you're going to link to, but you're going to do them a little

122
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
bit differently.

123
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,760
What I recommend is to start with this one, start with the Contact Me page, which is a little bit

124
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,390
simpler.

125
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,580
And then once you've got that working, then go ahead and do the second challenge up here.

126
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,090
I think you should be able to do this.

127
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,680
You might have to do a little bit of thinking, especially figuring out how to get an image that works

128
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,330
as a link, but I think you will be able to do it.

129
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,760
I'm rooting for you.

130
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Pause the video and complete the challenge.

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,420
All right.

132
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,620
So how did that go?

133
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,590
Well, let's see if we can get it working.

134
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,790
Firstly, I'm going to go ahead and switch to show preview so that I see my existing index.html slide

135
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,340
so I can see if what I'm doing is actually working.

136
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,480
Now, my first challenge is to add a link, so an anchor tag to my contact me page.

137
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,470
So I'll need to set the href to the Contact Me page from the index.html. In order to get to the Contact

138
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,920
Me,

139
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:53,860
I first have to go into the directory which contains my index.html using ./ and then here I can

140
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,410
see my public folder and then I can go into my contact.html.

141
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,250
Now I can add the text for my link, which I'll say contact me and let's test it out.

142
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:12,280
If I click on it, it goes to the contact.html page and if I go back, I go to my home page.

143
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,890
So that's one challenge check.

144
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,010
Next one is this one, which is a little bit harder.

145
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,510
But let's start with what we know.

146
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,790
We know how to create an anchor tag, which we know we need to link to the "about page."

147
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:32,750
So let's set the href to go up into the current folder that contains my index.html and then go into

148
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:39,110
public and about.html. Instead of having text in here,

149
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:47,510
what we can have is an image tag and hopefully, this is what you've worked out. For our image to work,

150
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:56,780
we need to set a source (src) and if you have your own image, then you could drop it into the image folder

151
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,380
here

152
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,690
but if you don't, or in this case, in my example, I'm going to link to that cat image.

153
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:09,260
So again, I'm going to go into the current working directory, the current folder, and here I'm going

154
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,930
to go to assets, images, cat.png.

155
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,750
And now we have an image that links to the about page.

156
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,140
Did you manage to get this to work?

157
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,960
And if you did get it to work with the cat.png, I recommend taking your own photos somewhere from

158
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,520
your computer, dropping it into this images folder and try getting your own face up into this website.

159
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,730
I think that will be super cool and it's very achievable.

160
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,940
So if you haven't done that, give that a go now and once you're done, then head over to the next lesson

161
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,560
where we're going to learn about the HTML boilerplate and how to structure a website HTML in the proper

162
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,130
fashion.

163
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,890
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
