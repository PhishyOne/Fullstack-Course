00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:05,900
Hey guys, welcome to this bonus lesson on hosting your website.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,710
I'm going to be teaching you a little bit about Web Hosting, how it works,

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,320
and by the end of the lesson, I'm going to show you how to make the website that you built in the

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,290
last project actually go live on the Internet so you can share it with all of your friends and family

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,640
and impress them all.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,360
All right.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,590
So let's get started,

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,170
what exactly is Web Hosting?

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,600
It's basically the process of making your websites available anywhere on the Internet.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,160
So then somebody from Cuba, or somebody from America, they can all access it no matter where they are.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,480
How do we do that?

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,360
Well, in order for it to be available to everyone, first we have to put our website and all of the

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,300
files and data that it consists of,

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:58,700
so our index.html, our images, et cetera, all onto what's called a web server.

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:05,129
Now what's different about a web server is that it's actually connected to the Internet.

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,750
So what that means is that the stuff that you put on there will be available 24/7 and ready

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,760
for anyone from anywhere in the world to access all of these files.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,550
And that's what's required to be able to view your website.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:28,140
Now at the moment you're able to view your website locally because all of the files are on your computer.

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,590
Right?

21
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,200
And this is what we call local development.

22
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,950
It means that all of the files and folders are locally available on your computer.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,410
So any images and any HTML files,

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,430
they're all on this computer.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,180
Now, what happens when somebody else say your neighbor wants to access that website?

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,690
Well, you would need to copy over those files to them,

27
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,050
or as we've been doing, downloading the zipped versions of those files and opening-up locally.

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,970
But this is not how we want to host our website,

29
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,350
instead, we want to take our website onto a web server.

30
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:18,300
And it's this process of taking all of the files and folders that make up your website and putting that

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,530
onto a web server that's hooked up to the Internet,

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
this process is what we call web hosting.

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,740
So now let's go ahead and take our HTML Portfolio Project, which we created in the last lesson and

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,290
go ahead and host it on the Internet.

35
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,680
In order to do this, the first thing I want you to do is to head over to github.com.

36
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,100
And once you're there, I want you to go ahead and sign up to a new GitHub account if you don't already

37
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,850
have one,

38
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,700
otherwise just sign in to your GitHub account.

39
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,280
Now, once you've signed up or signed in, you should see the homepage that looks something like this,

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,010
and I want you to go to this plus arrow on the top right and create a new repository.

41
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,360
And once you've done that, you can go ahead and name your repository html-portfolio.

42
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,480
You can go ahead and add a description for what this website is all about, but that's completely optional.

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,380
Now I want you to make sure that you have this as public.

44
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,000
Now you'll only see the private option if you actually pay for a GitHub account, but we want to be

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,610
able to host our website for everyone to see,

46
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,180
so we want to make sure that public is the one we select.

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,350
Then go ahead and tick this box and add a README file.

48
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,730
This is very important,

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,310
otherwise, it might be quite difficult for us to upload our files, and then finally go ahead and click

50
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,900
"Create Repository".

51
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,740
Now we should see a page that looks like this.

52
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:56,010
This is going to be the place where we're going to upload all of our websites, files and folders,

53
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,110
and we're going to do that by clicking the dropdown add file, and then we're going to select upload

54
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,590
files because we've already got them on our computer.

55
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:12,570
So now go ahead and navigate to the folder where you created your HTML Portfolio Project and you'll

56
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:20,370
see all of the associated files and you should have an index.html with all of the code that you've written.

57
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,310
So when you open it, make sure that it actually does work and it does actually contain your active

58
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,030
website.

59
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,720
Because remember when you downloaded this portfolio, the index.html was blank and only after you completed

60
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,540
the exercise does it contain all of the code.

61
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,980
And it's really important that your home page code is inside index.html because this is what GitHub

62
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,090
is going to look to in order to render your home page.

63
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:55,530
It's a good idea to also just check the spelling and make sure it's a lowercase "i" and its index.html

64
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,310
and you haven't renamed it something like home,

65
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,250
or me, or anything else, that is not going to work.

66
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,390
This is very, very important for this step to work.

67
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,150
Once you've verified all of that and made sure that you've got all the things that you need, for example,

68
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:20,020
the images folder contains all the previews, and your public folder contains all of your other HTML pages

69
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,290
then you can go ahead and take all of these files and drag it into here.

70
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,630
Now, again of note, it's important that you don't drag this entire folder in,

71
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,830
that's not going to work,

72
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,980
you want to drag in the contents of that folder.

73
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,210
Now, once that's done, you can see it has uploaded all of those files and now you can click on commit

74
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,780
changes to add those files to GitHub.

75
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,540
Once your files have processed, which can take several minutes and you might need to refresh the page

76
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,600
a few times in order to get this page up and running,

77
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,800
then I want you to first make sure that all of your folders and files are definitely listed here.

78
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,960
If they're not, then you might have to go ahead and upload them again.

79
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:16,580
And once you've verified that, then I want you to go into settings and inside settings

80
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:24,830
I want you to navigate to pages and then inside pages we're going to change this part under branch.

81
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:32,090
So we're going to change from none, over to the main branch, which contains our root folder and all

82
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,870
of the files that we just uploaded.

83
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,710
So go ahead and hit save for that to go through.

84
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,950
Once that's done, you should be able to refresh the page a couple of times and you should see this

85
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,880
little pop up which says that your site is live at this location.

86
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,340
Now, just another heads up,

87
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,610
this process can take anywhere between 1 to 10 minutes.

88
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,510
Sometimes I just sit here refreshing this page until I see this pop up.

89
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:03,590
But depending on how busy GitHub is, how many people are using it, this process can take a while,

90
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,320
so you can just have a cup of tea and come back.

91
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,450
Now this is an important point

92
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,790
sometimes you might get this error message that says, "No server is currently available," or some other

93
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,840
sort of error message,

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
don't worry about this,

95
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,410
simply just go back and try again.

96
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,740
Once you've refreshed this particular page and you see this little box here, then that means we're

97
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,080
ready to go ahead and visit our website.

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:35,660
So let's click on visit site and you can check to see all the pages work and make sure that's exactly

99
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,550
how you had it locally.

100
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:44,150
And once you're done, then you can actually take this URL and share it with anybody across the world

101
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:50,840
and they will be able to see your portfolio and of course, be sure to share it in the Q&A so that the

102
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,450
rest of us can also admire your portfolio and see the great work that you've done.

103
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,080
I hope you've had fun in this section creating your portfolio, learning about multi-page websites,

104
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:10,640
and finally understanding web hosting and seeing how we can host our website online using GitHub, hosting

105
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,940
it on the live World Wide Web.

106
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:21,590
In the next section, we're going to be learning about CSS and how to style our website so that we lift

107
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:29,420
our website from this '90s style simple website to something that looks incredibly beautiful.

108
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,710
For all of that and more,

109
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll see you on the next section.
