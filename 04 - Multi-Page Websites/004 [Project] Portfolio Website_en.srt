1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,650
All right.

2
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,070
Well done on making it to the end of the section.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,840
And it's time for your project.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,540
In this project, we're going to be building your very first Web Developer Portfolio.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,520
It's a website where you're going to be able to show off all of your work.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:24,530
Most web developers and designers out there will have their own website where they actually show people

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:31,100
what they've built before and link to those websites that they've created so that if somebody wanted

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:37,370
to hire you, they would be able to look at this page, see what you've done, and then maybe contact

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,290
you or learn more about you.

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,200
And this is the website we're going to make, but we're going to make a very simple version of it using

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,670
just HTML.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,820
What you need to learn in order to do this and hopefully you already know how to do this, but we need

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,710
to be able to take screenshots.

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,680
Now on your computer, it will be different whether if you're on Windows or if you're on a Mac or if

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,690
you're on Linux.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,070
What I want you to do, if you don't know how to take screenshots on your particular computer, is just

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,550
to go into Google and search for how to take screenshot on Windows Mac or Linux, depending on what

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,080
system you're working on.

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,730
Once you've figured that out, then we can proceed to download the Portfolio Project zip file and extract

20
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,400
it and open it inside VS Code.

21
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,160
There's quite a lot of files I've got in here.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,650
If you take a look inside the goal.png, this is what we're trying to create a very simple HTML

23
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,800
only portfolio website.

24
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:44,400
It's got a title, it's got a subtitle, it's got some horizontal rules, but we've also got the two

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,740
projects that we've built so far: the Movie Ranking Project from Section 2 and the Birthday Invite

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,750
project from Section 3.

27
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,530
What we're going to do is we're going to add an image which is a screenshot of each of those projects,

28
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,680
and we're also going to link to each of those projects,

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,890
and also an About Me and Contact Me page.

30
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:11,970
If you look inside the public folder, I've actually already got the movie-ranking.html and the

31
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,070
birthday-invite.html.

32
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,110
Notice that the code here is the project code that you've written before,

33
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:26,490
what I recommend is to actually replace the code here with your own code because it will probably be

34
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,510
a little bit different.

35
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,670
You might have customized it, you might have made it look a lot better than the standard version,

36
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,580
and your birthday is probably not on the 12th of May.

37
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,910
Similar with the Movie Ranking, your top three movies is probably different and I want you to take

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,740
the code that you've previously written because we're taking this portfolio website seriously, right?

39
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,450
We're actually going to show off what we've done so far, which is actually a lot already.

40
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,470
And I want you to customize the About page, the Contact Me page, basically make it your own web page

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,510
because later on we're going to be putting this live on the Internet, which you can share with anybody

42
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,350
in the world.

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,960
So let's take this project seriously.

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,600
What I mentioned about screenshots, the reason why we're doing it is so that when we look at our website,

45
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,960
we can see a little preview of the project that it's going to link to so that people can see which ones

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,080
they actually want to go and take a closer look at.

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,390
And in order to do this, we're going to right-click on the files that you've got, say, the birthday-

48
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,490
invite, show preview,

49
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:40,650
and once our preview is up, we're going to take a screenshot of it using whichever method you've discovered.

50
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:47,370
And once you've got that screenshot, then you can go ahead and drag it into the assets folder.

51
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,970
And inside the asset folder there's the images folder.

52
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,840
So there you have your screenshot and then you can go ahead and rename it to a sensible name, whatever

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,460
it is you want.

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:05,520
And this is how we're going to end up with some preview images for our website.

55
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,470
Now you can see there's already some images I've got in there, so in case your screenshot doesn't work

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,540
or you can't figure out how to use it, or you simply just want to do this project quickly, then you

57
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,350
can of course use the images I've already included for you.

58
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:26,910
But what you need to do is a seven-step process and I've added seven to-do's in there.

59
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,090
Just like any real web developer working professionally, you would split your big task, creating this

60
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,370
portfolio website into smaller tasks such as here are seven to-do's.

61
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:43,290
So first step, create the HTML boilerplate using what you learned from the last lesson.

62
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,960
Change the title to whatever it is you want.

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Add your previous projects' HTML into the public folder, so replace the code in here with your own.

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,330
Then take screenshots of your projects and add it to the images folder here.

65
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,880
Rename them and make sure you've got them

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,850
ready to go.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,630
Then go ahead and add some titles or subtitles, your portfolio, your web developer, whatever it is

68
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:15,940
you want to do, using what you've learned from previous lessons, then add a link to the project pages.

69
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,180
For example, the Movie Ranking Project link here,

70
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,400
this is an anchor tag.

71
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:27,160
This is the Birthday Invite Project anchor tag, and these two should link to their respective web pages,

72
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,260
so birthday-invite.html or movie-ranking.html.

73
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,730
And then we want to add the images in order to show off the previews.

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,860
Now, I've got a hint in here because you might find that when you take a screenshot, the image ends

75
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,650
up being massive and it doesn't really render properly like what we see in the goal here.

76
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:53,620
So a small, tiny image instead it might take up the entire page and it will look very, very awkward.

77
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:00,500
So one of the things you can do is set an attribute on the image element, which is the height, and

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,860
you can set it to 200, which means it'll be 200 pixels high and it will automatically figure out the

79
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,400
width.

80
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,280
And if you want to learn more about this, I've included a link to the Developer Documentation so you

81
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,570
can read up on that attribute and see how it works.

82
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,700
Now, once you've made the image show up and made it smaller, the final thing to do is to add the Contact

83
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,050
Me and About Me page links at the very bottom down here.

84
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,940
So maybe add a horizontal rule.

85
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,690
You can add whichever HTML elements you like because this is your project, this is your portfolio.

86
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,480
And of course, in later lessons, when we learn more about styling and CSS, we can jazz this up,

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,680
but at this stage, we're just aiming for a very simple HTML-only project page like this.

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,760
So I'm going to leave you to it and I want you to really put some time and energy into this portfolio

89
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,390
because it's going to be shown off to the entire world.

90
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,880
Pause the video and give that a go.

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,810
Now, I want to briefly run through my solution with you,

92
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,020
but remember, this is just an example.

93
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,410
It's your website and you can make it however you like.

94
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,000
But a couple of things to note is firstly, I've got my HTML boilerplate here.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,420
I've removed the unnecessary meta tags, I've changed my title, I've added in some h1's and h2's,

96
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
and horizontal rules just to separate some of the content,

97
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,480
but more importantly, I've got my anchor tags in. This anchor tag links to the movie-ranking html,

98
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,910
and this is embedded inside an h3 so that it will be a little bit bigger.

99
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,910
And I've got an image that will show off the preview of that particular web page.

100
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,850
And at the very bottom, I've got my two other pages, my About and Contact.

101
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,510
In this case, what the preview looks like is like this.

102
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,200
When I click on this link, it goes to one of my projects.

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:08,740
This link goes to one of my other projects and at the bottom, I've got the About Me and Contact Me pages

104
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,920
that will tell people a little bit more about myself.

105
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:19,390
Hopefully you've created something similar and in the next lesson there's a bonus lesson where I want

106
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:24,790
to show you how to put this live onto the Internet so that you can share it with your friends and share

107
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,580
it with us; the other students and myself,

108
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,300
so we can see the beautiful portfolio website that you've built.

109
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,840
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
