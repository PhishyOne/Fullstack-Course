1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,000
It's now time for the final project.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,480
And in this project, we're going to be building a flag of Laos using only CSS and HTML.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,700
If you take a look at this image, it looks like an oil painting, right?

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:20,390
But actually, if you look behind the scenes, this is created completely just with HTML and CSS, which

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,170
is completely crazy.

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,670
If you head over to this URL (https://diana-adrianne.com/purecss-lace/), you'll see the portfolio of Diana Adrian, who is a CSS artist.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:35,780
And if you right-click on this image and you inspect it, you can see that all aspects of this painting

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:41,600
is all created using CSS, which is completely mind blowing.

9
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,720
For example, if we take a look at something really simple, the hair here, you can see there are like

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,770
a million divs in here, each strand having a div.

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,290
And then if you look inside each strand, you can see they've got border-radius set, width, height,

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,760
different colors, etcetera.

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,970
And it's this crazy complex CSS art.

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,230
If you're not into oil paintings, then maybe you're into The Simpsons.

15
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,520
These images of The Simpsons were all created using CSS, and if you head over to this URL (https://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/), then you

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,330
can actually click on each of these characters and you can see the CSS that was used to create them.

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,370
And it's not surprising that it's a ton of CSS to write.

18
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,710
So don't worry, this is not your challenge.

19
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,920
We're not going to be creating something crazy like Krusty the Clown with 875 lines of CSS.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,010
It's just for you to be aware of the power of CSS.

21
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:44,060
And once we learn the different ways of combining selectors, of the specificity of CSS selectors,

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,540
positioning things, different properties, you can in fact eventually create crazy stuff like this,

23
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,750
if you have a ton of time and probably an artistic streak as well. Most of the time when I work with

24
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,160
CSS, my results look like this weird Pikachu where things are not positioned correctly and everything's

25
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,440
just moving in the wrong directions.

26
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,090
So you're not alone.

27
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,720
Most people write CSS code that creates weird pikachus.

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,170
The important thing is we understand why we get weird pikachus and why the eyeballs are so far down.

29
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,930
So we're going to consolidate what we learned in this lesson by creating the flag of Laos.

30
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,450
And this is going to test everything you've learned about combining different CSS selectors about CSS

31
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,310
specificity, the CSS cascade, and also about positioning.

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,950
And in the end, we will have this beautiful picture of the flag of Laos.

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,400
Go ahead and download the starting project files and extract it.

34
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,810
Now here, if you open up the index.html, you will see some very simple HTML that I've already set

35
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,560
up for you.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,800
And if you preview it on the right, you'll see it has pretty much nothing, which is a great starting

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,180
point for your project.

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,940
The important thing is you don't change any of the HTML, so don't touch the index.html file at all.

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:13,290
It's purposely vague in terms of classes and IDs and nothing is really tagged with anything.

40
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,770
Right?

41
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,790
And this is because we're doing a challenge, right?

42
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,800
You can of course add loads of classes, loads of IDs and make this project super, super easy,

43
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
but I want to test you on what you've learned so far.

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,510
So that's why the initial index.html has basically nothing for you to be able to target with your selectors.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,580
Instead, you have to be a little bit more crafty.

46
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:42,210
What we're aiming for is this. The flag doesn't have to be centered or positioned in any sort of particular

47
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:42,750
way.

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,120
This is going to be the top left corner, right here, and then there going to be a sort of rectangle that

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,800
occupies part of your website.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,080
But the important thing is that it has these different aspects to it.

51
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:02,580
It's got a red section here, which is 50% of this blue section here, and then it's got another red

52
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,660
section down here, which is also similar in terms of how much it occupies and how it works is there

53
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,970
is a big red div right here and above it there is this blue div on top.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,950
So that should already help you in terms of how this layout should look.

55
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,850
Now the next thing is we've got a paragraph element that's located at the top and we've got another

56
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,650
paragraph element that has to be inside a white circle.

57
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,010
If you take a look inside the index.html, you'll notice that there are some hints in here, for example,

58
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,880
the width and height of the flag and also the width and height of the circle.

59
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,900
If you want to get hold of the precise colors.

60
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,230
Remember previously we learned about CSS inspection and I've added a URL in here for you to be able

61
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,880
to inspect on

62
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,240
the actual image of the flag of Laos.

63
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,480
This will test you on something you've learned previously as well.

64
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:13,350
Remember, you can also right-click on the solution without opening the file and show it as a preview.

65
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,500
And you can of course take the URL from VS Code and paste it inside your browser in order to see what

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,210
the final outcome should look like

67
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,530
so you can better compare your version versus this version.

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,130
You can do this in many, many different ways.

69
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,390
And the main thing I want to know is that you know how to combine selectors, you know, about CSS specificity

70
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,220
and you know how to position things roughly on screen.

71
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,450
Once you're ready, pause the video and complete the project.

72
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,760
All right, let's go through the solution together.

73
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:53,910
The first thing is to style the outermost div, which has a class of ".flag".

74
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,110
So this is probably going to be the easiest part of this whole project.

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:10,140
We can target that div and set it to be 900px wide and 600px high so that we have a rectangle.

76
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,510
Now next we're going to have to set the background color so we can actually see it so that it's not

77
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,350
white.

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,800
In order to get the colors of the flag, remember I said we should inspect on it and then we can go

79
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,790
into the three dots, more tools, CSS overview,

80
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,820
and if we capture the overview, we'll get our hex codes.

81
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,410
So the red, which is our first box, has this hex code, which I'm going to copy and then paste into

82
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:37,920
here.

83
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:44,530
And now we have a very large rectangle in our preview.

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,960
Now the next step is to add this second rectangle on top of it.

85
00:06:50,260 --> 00:07:00,430
If we take a look at our HTML, you can see we've got a div with class flag as the highest, most div

86
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:07,270
and then we've got as its children a paragraph element and another div and then we've got finally another

87
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,920
div and a paragraph element.

88
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,870
So this second div enclosed is going to be the one that we're going to turn blue.

89
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,440
Remember I said we can't change any HTML so we can't add any classes or IDs to it.

90
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,220
Instead, we're going to combine some selectors to select this particular div.

91
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,140
So what is an identifying feature of it?

92
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:37,510
Well, it is the direct descendant, the immediate child of this div class, so we can use the child

93
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:45,520
combination by saying let's get the class ".flag" and then the angle bracket and then the child div.

94
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,550
And in this div we're going to go ahead and give it a width and a height.

95
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,480
The width, we want it to be 100% of its parent.

96
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,430
So I'm just going to write 100% and it should end up being 900px.

97
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,220
Alternatively, you can write the pixel number.

98
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,430
Next, we're going to give it a height and I'm going to say 300px.

99
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,920
This way it takes up exactly half the height of the big red pot.

100
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,060
Now we just need to give it a background color in order to see it.

101
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,210
And the color is going to be this blue color.

102
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,800
And there we have it.

103
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,880
We have a blue rectangle inside a red rectangle.

104
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,640
Before we get busy positioning things, let's just make sure that we've got everything on screen first.

105
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,860
So I want the circle to show up.

106
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,630
And coming back to our HTML, you can see we've got one div.

107
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,059
This is the red rectangle.

108
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,270
Inside there's another div which is the blue rectangle.

109
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,370
And finally inside that we've got another div which we're going to turn into the circle.

110
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,340
How do we get hold of this one?

111
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:03,160
Well, we could use the descendant selector because this div is the immediate child of this div, which

112
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,440
is then a child of this div.

113
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:14,080
So we're saying it's three levels down and we can do that by saying the ".flag" class has a child, which

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,880
is a div which has another child, which is a div and this particular div we're going to give it a width

115
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:31,390
of 200px and a height of 200px and we're going to give it a background color of white.

116
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,120
And we should now see a little square here.

117
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,220
And in order to turn it into a circle, we set the border-radius to 50%.

118
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,460
So now we've got all three shapes on screen and it's time to try and position them so they look a bit

119
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,660
more like this.

120
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:56,010
Notice that this blue rectangle is not only half the size of the rectangle, but it's also shifted down

121
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,450
by a quarter.

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,150
So we want to set its position.

123
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:08,790
Now, as I mentioned, in order to set the position of an element relative to a parent, what you need

124
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,980
is for the child element,

125
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,900
so in this case, this rectangle that's inside this blue rectangle that's inside the red rectangle, to

126
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,080
have a position type of absolute.

127
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:34,950
And then if its parent has a position type of relative, then we can now set this blue rectangle relative

128
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,590
to this red rectangle.

129
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:50,210
So we can say from the top, let's shift it down by 150px, which is a quarter of 900px,

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,470
even though we set this red rectangle to have position relative and we didn't move it at all,

131
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:05,720
by setting it to relative, it enables us to modify the children's position relative to that parent.

132
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:12,020
And this is why you'll very commonly see this structure, a parent having position relative and a child

133
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,070
having position absolute.

134
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,100
And then we move it relative to the parent using the same strategy.

135
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,440
We can do the same thing for our circle.

136
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:30,290
Because our circle basically has to be in the middle of the red rectangle if we set the position of

137
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,510
this white circle.

138
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,610
To be positioned relative, then we can set it relative to its parent, which is the blue rectangle.

139
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,720
So in order to move it to the center of the blue rectangle, we have to shift it down so from the top

140
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,560
by 50px, because if we know that this height is 300px,

141
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,040
then half of it is going to be 150.

142
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:09,390
So then if we know that the radius of the circle is 100px because it's got a total height of 200

143
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:17,100
and a width of 200, then we know that in order for it to be in the center, it needs to be 50px

144
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,450
from the top.

145
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,970
And by similar calculation, we can work out that it needs to be 350px from the left.

146
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,540
Even though we did all our calculations correctly, you can see this white circle doesn't quite look

147
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,470
like it's right in the middle of this blue rectangle, right?

148
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:45,540
It's a little bit shifted to the lower part so we can diagnose our issues using pesticide.

149
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:52,860
In this case, you can see that we've got a div here, but we've also got a box above it and this is

150
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,600
the paragraph element.

151
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,540
And if we go ahead and inspect it inside the Chrome inspector, you can see that paragraph element has

152
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,910
a margin top and margin bottom.

153
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,390
If I go ahead and delete both of those margins,

154
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
then you can see our circle shifts bang into the middle.

155
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:17,740
So it's actually the margin around the paragraph element that's actually pushing the circle down because

156
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:25,390
it is within the flow of the HTML because by default, all elements are statically placed in the flow

157
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,370
of HTML.

158
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,650
Let's go ahead and implement that in our code.

159
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,020
We can select all the paragraph elements and set their margin to zero.

160
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,510
And you can see immediately our circle is now centered in the screen.

161
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,050
In addition, if we look at the goal image, we want to have the text super large.

162
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:54,520
You can play around with the font size, but the one that I used is 5rem and this will get you pretty

163
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,710
much the same size that you see here.

164
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,460
In addition, the text is centered both inside the circle and at the top.

165
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:10,220
So we need to set our text align to center and that gets it pretty much where it needs to be.

166
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,900
Now, the very last thing we need to do is to change the color of this part to white and this part to

167
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,680
black.

168
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:27,920
One way that we could do it is to simply set the color for all the text to white, and this will turn

169
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,050
everything white and will no longer be able to see this text even though it does exist.

170
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,190
And if we wanted to select that particular paragraph element, we don't have a good way of selecting

171
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,020
it with class or ID because we're not letting you change this HTML.

172
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,030
But you can of course use different combinations to get there.

173
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:56,540
For example, this paragraph element is a child of a div of another div of another div of a body.

174
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,120
There's actually a cheat code to doing this.

175
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:05,180
If we open up the inspector and find that paragraph element, we want to select right click on it,

176
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,180
go to copy and then copy selector.

177
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:17,060
And once you paste it in here, you'll see it's actually the selector that will allow us to target that

178
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,910
exact bit that we wanted to.

179
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:26,750
I don't recommend blindly copy and pasting things, so this is a little bit of a cheat code, but because

180
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,040
we now understand how this works, we can actually simplify this massively.

181
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,300
We know that what it's saying is find the body, find its child, that's a div, find its child, that's

182
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,060
div and then another child and then three levels deep,

183
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:48,680
there should be a paragraph tag which needs to be black. Because we understand this, we can vastly simplify

184
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,480
it by getting rid of that body,

185
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,730
or we could change this to the class ".flag", which would do exactly the same.

186
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,550
And we can even swap out these child symbols and keep it as a descendant selector.

187
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,330
So a paragraph element that is a child of this div, a grandchild of another div and a great-grandchild

188
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,500
of something that has this class, we'll select it and make it black.

189
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,730
This is a little bit of a roundabout way of achieving the goal.

190
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,500
You might have done something completely different.

191
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,800
For example, we know that by default everything is black.

192
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,360
So you could have also selected this paragraph element and turn it white instead.

193
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,500
But I just wanted to demo to you a neat feature of Chrome Inspector show you the cheat code after you've

194
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,610
done the exercise and let you know that this is also a possible way that you could try out in the future.

195
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:48,080
So now if we compare our flag with the solution flag, you can see it's completely identical.

196
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,930
Now, it might not be for you because maybe you've used a different method for positioning.

197
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:58,760
Maybe you've changed the font size to a different font size, but essentially you should be close to

198
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:04,460
this layout and hopefully in the process you've managed to use some of the skills that you learned in

199
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,510
this section.

200
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:13,730
The inspiration for this project comes from a website I came across by Michael Lascarides, and he basically

201
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:19,329
classified world flags in order of difficulty to draw.

202
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:25,339
So you can see all the way down here there is Serbia, which is pretty much the most complex flag to

203
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,380
draw because of the shield.

204
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,560
And there are other countries like Croatia or Mexico.

205
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:37,490
But at the very top there are the simplest flags, for example, Palau or Nigeria or Peru.

206
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,900
So if you want to have a go drawing your own country's flag, hopefully you're not in Serbia.

207
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,970
If you are, then good luck.

208
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,610
But if you're based in Austria or Bangladesh, then this should be quite doable using the skills that

209
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,170
you've learnt with CSS.

210
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,960
Enjoy, and I'll see you on the next section.
