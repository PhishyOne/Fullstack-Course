00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:06,530
Hey, guys, now that we've learned about Clients, Servers and Databases, let's talk about which are

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:11,240
the technologies that professional developers use to create these backends.

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:15,560
So the programming languages used on the Front-end are pretty fixed.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:23,600
It pretty much has to be HTML, CSS and JavaScript, because these are the only things that the browser

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,840
can work with.

6
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,740
And even though we've seen and worked with some frameworks on the frontend, and some common ones might

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:38,870
be React, Angular and Vue, these are all JavaScript frameworks and all that they do are they act as

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:46,070
the waiter who allows the client to interact with, ask questions about the menu, tell them that their

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,550
email is inputted in an invalid format,

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:57,860
do all of this front-end display and logic, and then when our request reaches the back-end, we can

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,680
actually work with pretty much any programming language.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,070
Now these are some of the most popular ones Java, Ruby, PHP, C-sharp, Python and JavaScript.

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,650
And the reason why the backend language doesn't really matter is because as long as you're able to

14
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:21,750
use something to generate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to send back over to the frontend, then

15
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,410
it doesn't really matter what language you use to do that.

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,350
For example, if I wanted to Google the sunniest place on earth, I could do that in Japanese, German,

17
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,390
French, English,

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,330
it doesn't really matter what language I use, as long as at the end I get the results back in a format

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,530
that I can read.

20
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:47,940
Now, some of the most common backend frameworks that you might come across on the internet are Rails,

21
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:59,310
which is Ruby on Rails, The Java Spring Framework, the C-sharp, ASP.NET from Microsoft, PHP will be

22
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,590
using Laravel or Cake.

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,720
And then there's Python, which includes Flask and Django.

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,979
And then finally there's JavaScript, which has Node.

25
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,420
Now the framework and language that we're going to be using and learning on the back end is Node.js.

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,750
And reason number one is in the name.

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:30,420
It is a JavaScript back-end framework and we've invested so much time learning about JavaScript in order

28
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,000
to use it on the front-end with React, also with Vanilla JavaScript,

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,580
and now we want to be able to reuse that knowledge of JavaScript to work with it on the backend using

30
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,750
Node.js.

31
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,850
That's not the only reason though,

32
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,890
it's not just because we already know JavaScript

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,290
so we're using Node.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:59,370
If you take a look at the latest StackOverflow Developer Survey, so they survey developers in this

35
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,270
case, 45,000 of them, and they classify them into Professional Developers and those who are Learning

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,880
to Code.

37
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:15,150
If we look at Professional Developers, the number one use of framework for developers is Node.js, and

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,430
this list mixes all of the frameworks, not just frontend or backend.

39
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:29,550
That's why you see React and Angular, and we're going to be covering the number one most popular framework.

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:35,940
So if you want to build a website and you want to be able to get access to the most helpful resources,

41
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,670
the most amount of documentation, the most amount of help online, then you're going to want to use

42
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,350
the most popular framework.

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,410
Also, if you want to get a job and you can see that the number one tool that professional developers

44
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,680
use is Node.js, that means that most of the jobs that are asking for a back-end developer or a

45
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,090
full-stack developer will expect you to know about Node.js

46
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,340
Now let's look at some of the other ones that I mentioned.

47
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,360
So ASP.NET, Django, Flask, that's Python, Laravel for PHP, Ruby on Rails,

48
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:17,820
these are all a lot less popular when you compare them with Node.js, and some of them don't really change

49
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,810
in their popularity.

50
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,310
There's always some work for people who are C-sharp developers.

51
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,650
There's always some work for people who work with Python, especially if you're working with a machine

52
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,820
learning web app.

53
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:37,290
Now, something like PHP, in the case of Laravel and Ruby, in the case of Ruby on Rails, I would

54
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,600
say are actually very much declining in popularity over the years.

55
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:50,190
And definitely, if you see a Web Bootcamp that's still teaching Ruby on Rails in this day and age,

56
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:57,810
you should probably think twice about signing up. And definitely, without a doubt, the most popular

57
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,520
backend framework that

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,810
you need to know is Node.js.

59
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:09,610
And because we can't make a 500 hour course, we have to focus on one technology instead of covering

60
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:15,520
all the technologies where you'll see me, you know, old and grey, and I'm still talking about one

61
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,720
of the other frameworks,

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,100
we have to make a choice.

63
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,930
And the choice that I've made is for ease of use because you already know JavaScript, but also the

64
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,680
most professionally important framework that you will be expected to know as a back-end developer,

65
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,780
which is going to be Node.js.

66
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,240
I hope you're excited to learn Node.js and we will start right away in the next lesson.
