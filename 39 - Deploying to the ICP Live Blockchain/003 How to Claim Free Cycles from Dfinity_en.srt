1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,730
All right, so now that we're ready and we're prepped, it's time to turn our locally developed and hosted,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:13,470
dbank and put it onto the live Internet computer network where you'll see it gets a URL that ends

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,090
with ic0.app.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,500
To get started, head over to faucet.dfinity.org and then click on the button to authorize

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,510
the faucet using your GitHub account.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,690
So you'll need to log in on GitHub. Now in order to prevent people from abusing the cycles

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,840
faucet, because after all, you sort of getting free resources, they've added a limitation where the

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,970
GitHub account has to be aged.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,970
So it has to have been created over 90 days ago.

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,600
That means you can't just create one now and be able to get more cycles.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,610
And this is why I'm saying when we're doing the deploy, we have to be ultra-careful so we don't waste

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,240
our cycles.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,060
In addition, the GitHub account has to be active over the last 30 days. And if you matched all of

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:03,300
that criteria and you log in, then you should be able to proceed to step two, where they want your principal

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,600
ID.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,440
Now the principal is basically a generic identifier.

17
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,230
It will refer to an entity that can be authenticated by the Internet computer blockchain, so that

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,890
can be a user like yourself or simply a canister.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,710
So the first time that you actually use the definitive canister SDK, it will automatically create a

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,020
default developer identity for you.

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,970
And this includes the principal.

22
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:34,020
So this principal ID or the principal identifier is basically associated with your developer identity.

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,010
It's used to identify you and allows you to control canisters or control applications that you build.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,600
And in our case, it will be used to determine where these free cycles are going to go.

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,290
So in order to find the principal ID, let's go ahead and copy this command and paste it into a new

26
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,860
terminal.

27
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,520
Once you've gotten that ID back, then copy it entirely and paste it into the box there.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,810
Next, we're going to generate a new cycles wallet.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,730
So click on that and click Continue.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,190
And then finally, it's going to take a few seconds to set up everything behind the scenes.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,110
And then once that's done, it'll show you your balance in terms of terra cycles.

32
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,230
So this is 15 terra cycles that I've got, which currently is equivalent to about $20.

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,830
Now, remember that you can't actually convert this back to real money

34
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,250
unfortunately. It's not like a token, like the ICP token where it's freely exchanged and traded.

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,970
This can only be used to power our canisters on the internet computer blockchain.

36
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,990
So now that we've got our free cycles, the final thing to do is to copy this command and to set the ID

37
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,400
of our default wallet.

38
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,490
And in order for this to work, we first have to make sure that we cd over to our dbank project.

39
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,960
And then once you cded over, go ahead and simply paste that command into the terminal and then it should

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,220
do a bunch of things until it tells you that your wallet has been set successfully.

41
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,850
And now that you're all set, it's time to check our balance.

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:13,260
And to do this, we need to copy the ID that we got previously when we connected our wallet and then

43
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,280
we need to add .raw.ic0.app.

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,900
And once you head over there, it's going to ask you to authorize yourself.

45
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,850
And in order to do this, we have to create what's called an Internet identity anchor.

46
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,400
Basically, this is similar to a login with Google, a log in with Facebook, but in this case, we're

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
logging in with our Internet identity.

48
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,950
So in order to create this, let's first provide a name for our device, and then it's going to ask

49
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,410
us, how do you want to verify your identity?

50
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,020
If you have a USB security key, then choose that.

51
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,240
But otherwise just use this device.

52
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,690
And this way you will verify with the password that you used to log on. And once you confirm, it's going

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,430
to give you an internal identity

54
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,280
anchor, so make sure you write this down and keep a hold of this because you won't be able to get hold

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,570
of it if you lose it and you won't be able to authenticate yourself with your wallet with all your cycles.

56
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,100
So that could be a big problem.

57
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:14,220
So write it down now on a piece of paper, back it up, save it somewhere where you won't forget and

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,870
then you can click Continue.

59
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,050
It's a good idea to set up a recovery mechanism now in case you forget your anchor. So you can choose

60
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,660
the seed phrase if you don't have a security key.

61
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,420
And it's going to give you a whole bunch of words which you're going to need to write down again, maybe

62
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,080
offline, so that nobody can get access to it through the Internet.

63
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,590
Now, finally, once you're done with that, click the continue button and then we can register the

64
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,250
device.

65
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,490
So copy the code here and then type it into the terminal.

66
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,430
And once that's done, if you hit refresh, you should be able to see your cycles represented on this

67
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,000
website.

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,990
You can see at the moment I've got 14 terra cycles and it shows who are the principals who control

69
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,880
this wallet. And later on,

70
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,500
once we start deploying, you'll see the canisters that's created from this wallet as well.

71
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,450
That's all it takes to tap into the faucet and get some of these free cycles.

72
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,930
But now that we have our cycles, in the next lesson, we're going to use them to deploy our dbank application

73
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,450
to the live Internet computer blockchain.

74
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,330
So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson.
