1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,110
So now that we've deployed our web application, you can see how easy it is to host something on the

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,090
Internet computer and how we can now make it available to anybody across the world.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,350
Now, what if we wanted to host a static website instead?

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,770
Something much smaller, something with a lot less resources.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,170
So instead of paying a hosting company or, you know, getting it through GitHub, we could actually

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,760
do it on the Internet computer.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
And I want to quickly show you just how easy it is.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
In the course resources, you'll be able to download this CSS - My Site.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,730
And once you've downloaded it, go ahead and unzip the file and you should be able to see an index.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:41,340
html.

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,830
If you double click on it, you should be able to open it.

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,440
And this is the very simple website that we developed when we first learned how to use CSS.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,990
In today's lesson, I want to go ahead and show you how we can host this on the Internet computer.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,990
Now, ideally, of course, you would probably want to host your own website rather than my own.

16
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,560
But in case you can't find it, you can go ahead and download this as well.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
Once you've gotten hold of that, let's go ahead and take a look at the file structure.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,520
So you can see we've got a folder called CSS with our styles, a favicon.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,200
We've got a couple of images, not too many, and they're all quite small, at least in my case.

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,810
And then we've got our index.html.

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,320
So in total, there's probably only a couple hundred kilobytes that makes up our entire website.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,520
And as we mentioned before, the size of your website determines the cost for deploying and hosting

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
it on the Internet computer.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,860
So for a small static site like this, it won't cost very much at all.

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,880
Now, in order to get started, we're going to bundle all of this into a new folder, and we're going

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,250
to call that folder our assets.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,160
This is going to be the assets of our website.

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,730
And if you take a look at our previous dbank project, you can see that inside the source,

29
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,330
there's also the dbank_assets which contains the CSS logo, the index.html and index.js.

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,660
So this is equivalent to that folder.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,050
Now in addition, we need to create a new file called dfx.json.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:24,840
So the easiest way to do this is to simply open up our project from our downloads folder inside VSCode

33
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,420
and then outside this folder of assets,

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,420
so inside the main folder, we're going to create a new file which we'll call dfx/

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,200
json.

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,900
j-s-o-n.

37
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,780
Now in this JSON file, we're going to describe how our canister looks to the Internet computer.

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,420
So we're going to open up a set of curly braces and then we're going to define the canisters.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,420
And this is going to be written in the format of a JSON or the JavaScript object notation, which we

40
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,100
covered a long time ago.

41
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,110
But essentially, we're going to define a canister which is called website, and this website is going

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,630
to have a type and a source.

43
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:17,940
The type is going to be set as assets, and the source is going to be pointing towards where those assets

44
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,390
are.

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,590
And because there can be multiple sources, we're going to add it as a array.

46
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,140
So inside here, we're going to add the assets folder, which is right here

47
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,610
so it's going to be up to find it.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,810
Now, just before we deploy, one of the things to be aware of is once we actually deploy our website,

49
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,770
our static website, the deployment process is going to collapse off all the structure.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,290
So it's going to take out all of these files, the ones that are inside the images folder, the one

51
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,280
that's inside the CSS folder, and put it all in the same level as our favicon and index.html.

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,710
So basically like this.

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,630
Now in order for this to actually still work with our index.html because if I open it up right

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,080
now,

55
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,790
you can see that it's completely not working.

56
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,890
So what we have to do is to get rid of our references where we reference our folders.

57
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,080
So we've got two folders in this project: css and images.

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,080
So let's change our references in here.

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,290
So I'm going to find all the places where I say css/, which is my CSS folder, and

60
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,340
I'm going to delete it.

61
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:39,950
And then I'm going to search for all the places where I've got my images source set as the images folder.

62
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,870
So I've got five locations and I'm just going to go ahead and delete all of those instances so that

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:55,030
we basically end up with just the image names .png and we change these references so that they are

64
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,980
on a flat structure.

65
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,850
So now that we're done, let's go ahead and hit save and we're ready to go and actually deploy this.

66
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,040
Let's open up a terminal and notice how it's inside the CSS - My Site.

67
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,510
And now we're going to go ahead and use that keyword

68
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,040
dfx deploy --network

69
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,310
ic

70
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,170
and hit enter.

71
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,860
And now it's going to create our canister on the Internet, computer blockchain and use some of the

72
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,100
cycles in our wallet to be able to do this and create it.

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,770
So once it's done all of that, it's deployed the canisters,

74
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:39,000
let's go ahead and take a look at what is the location of our canister,

75
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:39,880
so get the ID.

76
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:49,240
So to do that, the command is dfx canister --network, which is ic.

77
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,760
And then we're going to say we want the id of a particular canister.

78
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,300
And the canister name is right here.

79
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,630
We've defined this single canister, which is hosting our website.

80
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,480
And in my case, I've just named it website.

81
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,930
And if you type this along with me, then this will be the same for you as well.

82
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,800
So after the ID, we're going to put the name of our canister.

83
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:20,620
So now let's go ahead and hit enter and we get our canister ID. And now if we go back, you can see we

84
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,690
can follow the same format, which is the ID .raw.ic0.app.

85
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,190
So let's try that here.

86
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,270
So now if we load it up, you can see our favicons right there, our website's loaded up and this is

87
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,880
now hosted on the internet computer.

88
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,420
And you can send this URL to anyone and they'll be able to see your personal website hosted live on

89
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,860
the Internet computer blockchain.

90
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,940
So that's it.

91
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,880
That's how we deploy live to the Internet computer.

92
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,610
Now, if you've managed to successfully deploy your own personal site, be sure to post a link to your

93
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,010
own website down in the comments below

94
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,210
and we can all take a look at it and admire it. Now, because deployment costs so much in terms of cycles

95
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,210
and keeping these websites up cost cycles as well,

96
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,970
it means that once your container or your wallet runs out of cycles, then you static website might

97
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,630
go down.

98
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,180
So you have to keep your web site container topped up with cycles for the container to remain accessible

99
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,430
and online. In the future

100
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,810
when we're developing other projects, we're going to try and stay with local deployment.

101
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,060
That way it doesn't cost you any money, but if you want to make it live, you now have all the tools

102
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,360
at hand to be able to deploy it live on the internet

103
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,290
computer blockchain.
