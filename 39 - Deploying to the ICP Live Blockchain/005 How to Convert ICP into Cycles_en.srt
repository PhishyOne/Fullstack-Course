1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,680
So one thing to be aware of is that cycles can run out and when it does, because maybe you've created

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,450
too many new canisters, because you've hosted too large a file on there, then you either have to stick

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,010
with local development or somehow get hold of some ICP tokens.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,050
Typically, the way to get ICP tokens is via a cryptocurrency exchange.

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,440
Using an exchange, you can buy ICP tokens with your dollars or pounds or whatever your local currency

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:31,710
is.

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,650
You can see the largest and most established exchange is listed here, and at the time of recording

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,750
I've seen ICP tokens available on Binance, Coinbase and Kucoin, for example.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,980
But let me show you a neat trick on how you can get ICP for free.

10
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,130
Coinbase has this learn and earn section where you can take quizzes about various blockchain projects

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,810
and earn their tokens.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,380
So, for example, in this case, at the moment, there's a $3 prize on learning about fetch.

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:12,330
So we can read through this and we can do the quiz, and then we can earn prizes in the form of tokens

14
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,350
in this currency.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,860
So now I've earned $3 in fetch, and now I can go back and go to buy and sell.

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,260
And convert my $3 of fetch tokens into Internet computer or ICP tokens.

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,620
So let's go ahead and press convert all.

18
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,840
And you can see that this is the current exchange rate.

19
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:42,240
So I should get back about 0.016 of ICP, which is currently changing because the price varies on a

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,530
second by second basis.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,840
So let's go ahead and click convert now and we should be able to get hold of some ICP for free.

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,020
So now that we've got this amount of ICP, let's go ahead and convert it into cycles.

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,350
So to do that, we have to go to the network nervous system and let's go ahead and log in.

24
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,330
Once you're logged in and authorized, when you click on the ICP tab, you'll be able to see your wallet

25
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,220
address for your principal.

26
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:17,930
So here you can see I've got zero ICP currently, so if I copy this wallet address and I go back to

27
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,590
Coinbase and I go to send and receive, I'm going to select ICP to pay with.

28
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,780
And I'm going to send my $3,

29
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,890
or if you have more, you can click on Send All. And I'm going to send it to that address that I got.

30
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,420
So now we can go ahead and click Continue and click Send now.

31
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,420
And says that it has been sent.

32
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,850
So now let's click done.

33
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:56,040
Let's go back to our networks nervous system and let's hit refresh and see if that actually works.

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,760
And you can see it right now.

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,420
The ICP has been transferred from Coinbase and now it's inside my account, which I'm authorized with.

36
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,190
So now that we've got some ICP in our account, we can go ahead and convert some of those into cycles.

37
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,800
And to do that, we first have to head over to the canisters and then we're going to click on Create

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,090
or link a canister and we're going to link it to our wallet.

39
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,250
So head over to your wallet and go ahead and copy it.

40
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:38,230
Alternatively, you can go into the command line and type dfx identity --network ic get

41
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,760
wallet and you'll see the default wallet that's linked to your account.

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:51,160
So what we want is this canister ID for our wallet and then click attach canister, which may take a

43
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,640
while.

44
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,850
Now sometimes I get this error that says you're not the controller of this canister and cannot access its

45
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,390
details.

46
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,070
But then it sort of goes away.

47
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,410
So I'm not quite sure what's going on there.

48
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, let's go ahead and add some cycles to this wallet

49
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,730
and we're going to select Main as our source account and we're going to give it two cycles.

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,420
Two cycles is the minimum amount.

51
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,620
So let's go ahead and review our cycle purchase.

52
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:30,490
We're going to convert this many ICP into this many terra cycles or trillion cycles, and we can go

53
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,560
ahead and click confirm and send.

54
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,160
So now it says Transaction completed, let's hit close.

55
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,150
And if we go back to our cycles wallet and hit refresh...

56
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,960
we'll just have to log in and authenticate again.

57
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,110
Now, sometimes when you authenticate, you might see this register device because it doesn't recognize

58
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,790
it or something like this.

59
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,530
But actually, if you refresh the page, it normally updates.

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:06,990
So now you can see our balance is updated and we've received two terra cycles and we've topped up our

61
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,740
balance.

62
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,550
There you have it.

63
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,150
That's how you convert ICP into cycles to use for development.

64
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:24,080
And if we head back to our main wallet, you can see that it has gone down from 0.3376 to

65
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,990
0.2066.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
So we've spent some ICP and we've converted it into cycles.

67
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,580
So just in case you run out of cycles for deployment, this is how you can convert ICP into cycles and

68
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,590
continue to power your canisters.

69
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,100
Now in the next lesson, I've got a small challenge for you, and the challenge is to use the Internet

70
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,710
computer to host one of the websites that we built in the early part of this course.

71
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,070
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
