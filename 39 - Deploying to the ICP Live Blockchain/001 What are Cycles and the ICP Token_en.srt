1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,660
All right.

2
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:07,350
So in order to progress in our knowledge of how to work with the Internet computer, the next big topic

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,570
that we need to tackle is this concept of cycles.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:18,120
And this is what's going to enable us to actually deploy our creations onto the live Internet computer

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,630
network.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,210
So what have we been doing so far?

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,260
Well, we've been doing local development on local host, and we're using a simulated version of the

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,970
Internet computer in order to get a good idea of lag times.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,090
And also whether if the things we're building actually work.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,010
So we're doing testing, basically.

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,820
Now, once we're done, what we want to be able to do is to deploy our apps onto the live network.

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,210
So then it's accessible by anyone across the Internet

13
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,900
and it's also going to be on the ICP blockchain with all of the benefits that it entails.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,420
But how do we actually get there?

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,750
How do we actually deploy our app onto the network?

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,680
Well, once our app is live on the network, then it will start consuming computational resources from

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,270
these data centers across the world.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,590
So there has to be a way for us to be able to pay to use those resources.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,450
And the most common way is to get hold of some of these ICP tokens.

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,950
So these are the Internet computer tokens, and this is a tradable token that can be obtained in a number

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,550
of ways.

22
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,380
The easiest and probably the most straightforward is to simply purchase them or exchange another cryptocurrency

23
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,300
for your ICP tokens.

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,260
So, for example, if you go to a large exchange like Coinbase, then you can buy these tokens or you

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,300
can exchange your Bitcoin or Ethereum for these tokens and get hold of some of these.

26
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,370
So that's probably the most straightforward.

27
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,800
But in addition, there's a number of other ways.

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,010
And one that's quite interesting is through what's called the Network Nervous System. The internet

29
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,110
computer is controlled by what's called a Network Nervous System or the NNS.

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,280
And this is basically a governing system that controls all aspects of the Internet computer. That allows

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,580
you to basically time-log your existing ICP tokens and create what's called a neuron.

32
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,380
And then you can earn rewards by voting on the proposals.

33
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,260
So then you have direct control over what happens to the future of the Internet computer,

34
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,840
and in order to reward you for your participation, you earn ICP tokens.

35
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,220
The third way is to get a grant from the Dfinity Foundation.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,070
So they've set aside a whole bunch of money,

37
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:49,890
and as a developer, you can submit a proposal in order to apply for anywhere between $25,000 to $100,000

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,090
in ICP tokens to help you develop your next creation.

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,460
And that doesn't come with any sort of caveats.

40
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,150
They don't get a percentage of your company or anything.

41
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,140
It's just a straightforward grant.

42
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:07,020
And the final way to earn ICP tokens is by acting as a data center.

43
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,990
So as we mentioned, Dfinity links together a whole bunch of independent data centers across the world

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,690
to create a virtual shared computer.

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,290
So that means anybody with the infrastructure or who can purchase the infrastructure and supplies the

46
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:28,230
electricity in order to keep these data centers running, will be able to run a node within the Internet

47
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,190
computer and they'll get rewarded in ICP tokens for keeping these servers up and live available for

48
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,000
people to use.

49
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,870
So through all of these methods, what you end up with is this ICP token.

50
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:49,290
And once you got hold of some ICP tokens, then you can actually burn these tokens and exchange them

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,740
for computation cycles in your canisters.

52
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,340
So essentially you're turning something that is publicly tradable, that can be exchanged, can be bought

53
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,120
into something that cannot be traded but has value because it keeps your canisters up and running or

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,370
allows you to store data or allows you to perform computations in your web application.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,510
And you basically preload your canisters with this computation potential, which is called cycles.

56
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:18,779
right?

57
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:24,390
And as long as you've got enough cycles for the canister to continue performing its computation, then

58
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,200
it will stay up.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,070
So it's kind of a similar analogy to say if you have gas heaters or gas burners at home and you need

60
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:38,670
to go and buy some propane in these cans and you store them at home so that you can use them as you

61
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,180
need them.

62
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,690
But then every so often you might run low and you have to top it up.

63
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,260
So how are we going to be able to get hold of some of these cycles so that we can actually get our website

64
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,800
up and running on the live Internet computer network?

65
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,370
Well, there's actually a way that we can do this for free.

66
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,940
The dfinity foundation offers a cycles faucet.

67
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,950
They're giving you free cycles in order to build on the Internet computer.

68
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:13,380
Anyone who has a GitHub account that is over 90 days old can get access to a free $20 worth of cycles,

69
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,930
which allows you to start deploying your canister smart contracts, to build your web3 applications and

70
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,730
to get a taste for how to work with it.

71
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,150
So these free cycles are what we're going to be using in order to deploy our web applications in this

72
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,600
course.

73
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,620
But there is a huge, huge warning that comes along with it.

74
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,200
Remember that these are treated like money.

75
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,270
Once you deplete your $20 worth of cycles, then you won't be able to recharge it unless you decide

76
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,870
to buy some ICP tokens and convert it into cycles.

77
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,340
So as we're going along the tutorial, I want you to be super careful, especially with deploying to

78
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,370
the live network, because the different types of computation on the Internet computer come with different

79
00:05:59,370 --> 00:05:59,910
costs.

80
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,460
And you can see by far the most costly action you can do is to create a canister on the Internet computer,

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,110
which is basically when we first called deploy and put our canister onto the network.

82
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:20,850
Now, on July 26, 2021, it costs about 0.1 terra cycles to deploy a canister.

83
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,510
These days I've tested it out and it costs a little bit more than that.

84
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,130
So we have to be really, really careful when we use that dfx deploy method when we're putting it onto

85
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:32,700
the network.

86
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:39,420
And if you don't want to deplete your cycles prematurely and get stuck with no cycles or having to buy

87
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,080
ICP tokens to convert it to cycles, I want you to watch the videos carefully and maybe finish watching

88
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,200
the videos before you actually complete the actions.

89
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,630
That way we can try and conserve the cycles that we've got and use the cycles efficiently.

90
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,960
So now that I've put that warning out there, it's time to head over back to our project and deploy

91
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,110
it to the live Internet computer network.

92
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,150
So for all of that and more,

93
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,290
I'll see you on the next lesson.
