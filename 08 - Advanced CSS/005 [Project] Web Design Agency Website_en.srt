1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:00,710
All right.

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,750
It's time for the project, for this section.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:09,710
And in this project, we're going to be creating a beautiful website for a Web Design Agency.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,350
Usually with web design agencies, you'll see them demonstrating their best work, but their websites

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,850
are usually quite simple.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:24,770
So something with a big block of text telling people what they do and then just simple clean design.

7
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,930
This is what we're going to be creating.

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:35,060
We're going to be a Creative Design Agency at dev.com and we've got two little blocks of text that describes

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,530
a little bit about our work,

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,380
and finally, at the bottom, we've got a footer with our company motto, "Create, Develop Design."

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,790
But more importantly, our website actually scales responsively.

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,830
So when we create our website, we're going to make sure that when it's displayed on a smaller screen,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:03,210
namely an iPhone, that our blocks now change and are centered and are responsive to make better use

14
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,650
of the screen real estate.

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,490
So instead of having it side by side such as here, where we've got one block here and then one block

16
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,270
here, when the screen size is a certain size, they actually stack on top of each other.

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,000
So this is going to require a little bit of the knowledge that you learned in this lesson about the Display

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
Property, Floats and also Responsiveness.

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,810
Go ahead and download the starting project.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,590
The first thing I want you to do is to go ahead and open up the index.html and take a look at the code

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,990
that we've already put in here for you.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,170
You can, of course, design everything completely from scratch, but I think it's important that we

23
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,240
actually have a good pace of learning and we're practicing the things that we've actually just learned

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,160
about, rather than doing everything from scratch and not focusing on the important things.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,430
Go ahead and show it as a preview on the right.

26
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,250
And if you want to see it better, just copy that URL and put it into your browser.

27
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,020
Now, you can see this is basically just kind of like plain HTML, right?

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,190
We've got some nice fonts in here, we've got some images, we've got some text,

29
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,580
but essentially it hasn't really been designed for layout and that's what we learn all about in this

30
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,360
section.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,080
So now I want you to right-click on the solution.html, show preview, take this URL and put it up

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,310
side by side.

33
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:37,170
Now one way you can solve this project is to simply aim for this exact same layout.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,950
I'm not going to give you too many clues about how to achieve this layout.

35
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,630
I think it's time that you actually figure out how to break down a problem and see if you can create

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,740
something similar.

37
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,810
It doesn't have to be exactly the same,

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,910
you could just aim for similar.

39
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,830
But the important thing to remember is look at how this is laid out,

40
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,640
you've got an image, you've got text that's floating next to it,

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,960
you've got these two different sections are completely separate from each other

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,560
and then when you change the dimensions, when you hit a certain break point, this is pretty much for

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,040
mobile around sort of 600-ish,

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,370
then it actually stacks on top of each other.

45
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,180
Using what you've learned in this section, you should be perfectly able to add the modifications to

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,290
the index.html to create this look and feel.

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,540
Now I want to leave this up to you.

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,410
You can actually create an entirely different website if you want to

49
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,440
by modifying this starting file. You could lay it out however you like, using whichever methods you've

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,010
learned.

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,940
It doesn't have to end up looking like this, as long as it looks beautiful to your eyes,

52
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,020
I'm happy with it.

53
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,930
But remember, I want you to try out putting in responsiveness and try out some of the things you learned

54
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,770
in this section, such as block and inline-block and floats.

55
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:02,270
Just put some of those things into the CSS so that you have some practice doing these things.

56
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,710
Once you're done, you can take a look at the solution code to see how I achieved this particular layout.

57
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:14,780
And you can look back at some of the previous lessons if you're not quite sure how I achieved it in

58
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,600
the solution code, but I recommend don't look at the solution code until you're happy with your creation.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:27,380
So now go ahead, download the starting files, modify the layout, and if you've created something completely

60
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,840
different from the solution and you think it's amazing, you want to show off to everybody, then go

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,850
ahead and include a screenshot in the Q&A so that we can all admire your hard work.

62
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:45,830
So now it's time for you to shine and for you to design and use CSS to your heart's content to create

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,080
a beautiful website of your own making.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,180
So have a go at that now.

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,660
I hope that was fun for you and you managed to create something really beautiful.

66
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,480
I want to quickly point out some of the things in my solution code that I want to draw your attention

67
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,160
to in case you got stuck on how to recreate the layout that I had in the solution.

68
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:12,120
So the first thing I want you to notice is here I've created a span giving it a different class.

69
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:18,100
That means that in the solution I can target that particular class ".creative" and give it a different

70
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,640
color.

71
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:24,850
That's how I managed to have this part be blue rather than having it all the same color,

72
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,600
but layout-wise, it's completely within the same flow because it's simply an inline element that slots

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,050
in.

74
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,080
That's the first thing I want to draw your attention to.

75
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:41,740
The second thing is notice how I've got a media query targeting 680px and below,

76
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,080
if you remember from previously, this is going to give us access to a lot of the smaller devices where

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,340
maybe our two sided sort of blocks won't work,

78
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,160
so that we get that responsiveness where they stack on top of each other.

79
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:02,000
And the way that I've made them stack on top of each other is by simply changing the cards to have a

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,720
display of block so that they occupy the full width.

81
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,630
And then I've changed the width to 100% so that they go from edge to edge, changed the text to justify,

82
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:18,620
so that instead of being left-aligned, as you see here, they actually try to occupy the full-width

83
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,140
and the spaces get stretched out so that we have these clean lines, on either side of the paragraphs.

84
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,020
And of course, the way that we've managed to get these cards to go to the left and the right is using

85
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,200
what we learned about float, float-left and float-right.

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,580
So all in all, the solution should be easy enough to understand.

87
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,540
The only thing you might have never seen before is this "object-fit".

88
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,820
And what I want you to do if you're not quite sure about some code that you see in the solution code

89
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,330
is to simply Google for that property on MDN Developer Docs and read up on it because it's usually

90
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,110
something simple enough to simply understand by using the docs.

91
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,540
And this is an important workflow in any professional web developers life, so it's important to get

92
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,260
used to it.

93
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,920
I hope you had fun in this project and I'll see you in the next section.
