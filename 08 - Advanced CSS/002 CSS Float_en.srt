1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,110
Okay, so now that we've looked at the CSS Display Property, I want to cover another CSS property that's

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:10,460
really important for layout and that is the Float.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:17,210
And the main thing that this allows us to do is to wrap text around a particular element.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,150
What exactly does this allow us to do?

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,680
So we've seen previously that by changing the display, we could, for example, make our blocks go

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,390
on to the same line.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:33,320
So maybe there's one here and there's another inline-block here.

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,320
There could be another inline-block here, and we could use three inline-blocks to achieve this layout.

9
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:48,140
But if we wanted our text to be able to wrap around another element, such as in this case where it's

10
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,980
kind of this misshapen l, then this is going to require us to use the Float Property.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,330
The web really is an extension of print.

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,880
Previously we used to have these newspapers, and the way we lay out images and text is kind of what

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,510
we've borrowed in order to create the websites that we see these days.

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,780
You realize very often in the world how so many things get reused in different ways and getting good

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,260
at a particular thing, like laying out newspapers,

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,060
even if this skill dies, it still usually gets transferred into something else.

17
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,470
How do we use the float property?

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,720
So here, let's say that we have an image tag.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,270
I don't have the full content of the image or the text just so that we can save some space here and

20
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,520
understand what's going on in the CSS.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,060
But you can imagine this is an image element with the source, with an alt tag, and this is a text

22
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,950
with some Lorem ipsum that's about a paragraph long and it looks something like this. In the style.css,

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,490
let's go ahead and target the image and make it float: left.

24
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,780
Float is the name of the property and left is the value that we're setting that property to.

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:13,020
And as soon as this CSS is applied, then what you'll see is that our text will now begin to wrap around

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,070
our image.

27
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,340
So it fits around the image.

28
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,930
And we've done this by making this image float to the left.

29
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,770
We're not actually setting anything on the text here.

30
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,460
We can also change that float to right to make the image go to the right of the page and for the text

31
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,440
to wrap on the left.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,060
And those are probably the only two values we're going to be using on the float property.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:48,300
Essentially, if we had a normal HTML file with respecting the normal flow, then images by default

34
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,830
have display block.

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,330
So they're going to take up the full width even if they don't need to.

36
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,600
And then paragraph elements also are display blocks.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,840
So will take up the full width and then so on and so forth.

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,070
But if we wanted the text to wrap around the images, then we can simply take the image and set this

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:16,170
one to float: left and this other one to float: right.

40
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:27,460
And now these two elements are now taken out of the normal HTML flow and they're actually floating around

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,360
the text.

42
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,620
Now, sometimes, though, you might not want the text to wrap around the floated element.

43
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,980
Previously we saw if we had an image and then we had two paragraph elements, then we would want the

44
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:48,550
image to be floated left so that the paragraph text can flow around it.

45
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,540
However, if instead of having two paragraph elements, we actually had a footer here, then we actually

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:03,490
want the footer to be down here occupying the full width and not squished in to be wrapped around the

47
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,870
image right here.

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,210
So how do we achieve this?

49
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:15,370
Because as I mentioned, the float property is set onto the image and not onto the paragraph, whereas

50
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,130
the behavior that you can see occurs in the paragraph.

51
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,670
So the paragraph is the one that's actually wrapping around the image. In order to fix this and allow

52
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:33,680
the footer to be free of this floating image, then we need to use a related property which is called

53
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,190
"clear".

54
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:41,840
So here I've got an example where we've got an image element, a paragraph element, and finally we've

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,830
got a footer.

56
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,390
So normally in the footer you'll see something like copyright and then the name of the company.

57
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,260
It looks very weird having it placed here.

58
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:59,960
Instead we want it placed down here like any normal footer, but unfortunately because our image is

59
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,360
floated to the left, then everything else is trying to wrap around it.

60
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:13,220
So we have to change our CSS, we have to target the footer using the selector for that element and

61
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,440
then we have to set a property called clear.

62
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,540
And what this clear does is it clears any responsibility to wrap around things that are floating.

63
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:34,070
This footer is now cleared of the left float and that means it can go into its normal position and ignore

64
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,080
anything that's floating around it.

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,770
And this will end up looking something like this.

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:49,400
If we look at this layout of a web page here, you can see you might achieve this by having a block

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:59,060
over here, which is float: left and another section here, which is float: right,

68
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,980
and this will give us this kind of separation of these two.

69
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,720
Probably they're going to be divs, right?

70
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,490
Probably two squares.

71
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,540
And it allows them to line up side by side like this.

72
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,120
Now for the footer to be cleared of both of these.

73
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,190
So above it there's a float: left and there's something floating right that we need to set that clear

74
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,920
property to "both", and this means it's not going to wrap the thing on the right and it's not going to

75
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,210
wrap the thing on the left.

76
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:36,650
So now let's try an exercise and see if we can apply what we learned into writing our own code and setting

77
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,730
the float property.

78
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:45,780
If you download and extract the 8.1 CSS Float starting files and open up the index.html, you should

79
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,340
see that we've got a bunch of code that's already written for you.

80
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,640
If you look at the preview, you can see we've got cats and we've got dogs.

81
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:03,090
If we take a look at the goal image, then you can see what we're trying to achieve is to get a block

82
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,910
that floats to the left of the page and another one that floats to the right of the page,

83
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,100
and then to have a footer right below those two floating blocks.

84
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,060
Whereas at the moment what we've got is we've got two blocks that are stuck next to each other and we've

85
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:28,080
got a footer at the bottom, and the text in our blocks don't actually wrap around the image either.

86
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:36,510
So I want you to use what you've learned about float to modify the code in the style element of the

87
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,350
index.html to achieve this goal

88
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,890
look.

89
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:47,040
So you're going to need to think about how you can float this text around this image.

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,630
You're going to need to think about how you can do the same over here.

91
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,140
And then you need to think about how you can make this block go to the right, this block, go to the

92
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,550
left and have the footer go below both of those things.

93
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,290
It's going to need you to apply what you learned about floats and clear.

94
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,290
Pause the video and give that a go now.

95
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,810
All right.

96
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,660
So let's do the easiest thing first, which is to wrap our text around our images.

97
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,230
If we take a look at the structure of our text, you can see we've got two images.

98
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:31,950
And if we make both of these images float left, then we can probably get the text wrap to work.

99
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,210
So let's target the image element and then set float to left.

100
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:43,110
So if we look at the preview now, you can see that both of these images, once their is enough width,

101
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,120
maybe we can view it here in a full browser.

102
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,050
Once there's enough width, you can see that both of these paragraphs are now wrapping around our images.

103
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,300
So that's the first part checked.

104
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,630
Next thing we want to do is to make the cat-block float to the left so this aquamarine block, go to

105
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:09,720
the left and the dog-block, go to the right so that we can have this kind of layout.

106
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,630
To do that, we're going to use the float again.

107
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,750
And if we look at our code and see how it's formatted, you can see these blocks are just simply made

108
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,650
up of divs.

109
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,220
There's a cat div and there's a dog div and you can see we're already targeting those divs by changing

110
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,620
their background color to have them different.

111
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:38,190
Let's go ahead and make this cat div float to the left and make the dog div float to the right.

112
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,760
Now if we look at our website, you can see it's achieved that the cat block is on the left and the

113
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,810
dog block is on the right.

114
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:52,290
But our copyright has also gone all the way up to the top because these two things are floating.

115
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,350
So this footer is trying to wrap around both of them and the only space that's available is right here

116
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,490
in the center.

117
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,650
So we're going to have to use that trick

118
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,960
we learned about the clear property if we go into our footer and change the clear property so that it

119
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,680
clears both sides of the floats, then it now behaves properly and goes down right to the bottom.

120
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,080
And now we have our layout looking more or less like the goal image.

121
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,690
Don't worry if you have this little gap here.

122
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,040
That's because the height of the divs are not the same, because there's different amounts of words

123
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,540
in these paragraphs.

124
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:40,140
And this brings me on to an important point about using float as we're doing here for layout.

125
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:47,170
In the past, a lot of developers have used float extensively and sort of wrangled it to create these

126
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,820
kind of complex layouts.

127
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,630
Now I'm showing you this layout so you can use the clear property.

128
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,140
But in modern web development and web design, we don't actually use the float property to achieve these

129
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:05,560
kind of designs because there are much better tools for us like Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, whole load

130
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:11,050
of other things that is a lot less complicated to use and to understand than using float.

131
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:17,290
To achieve this, there can be very unexpected results if you're trying to achieve complex layouts using

132
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:17,860
float.

133
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,500
So I recommend to only use float when you want to wrap text around an image,

134
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,940
and in modern web design, this is what you're going to see most people doing as well.

135
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,960
So it's an important concept to learn and understand, but try to not use it on everything that you

136
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,530
see.

137
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,040
We've got better techniques, which I'll teach you very shortly.
