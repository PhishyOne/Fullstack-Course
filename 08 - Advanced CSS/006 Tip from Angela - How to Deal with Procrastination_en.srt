00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,120
Well done for completing yet another module. These modules are getting longer and longer and more and more

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,190
hard, and harder and harder.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,430
So by getting here you've really shown what you're made of.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,490
Not everybody makes it this far.

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:26,130
Now, while you're here, I want to share with you something that I've noticed about how I procrastinate.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,930
I'm sure everybody procrastinates,

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:40,640
but one of the things that really struck me is, when I used to have to revise or study for med school,

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:48,780
one of the things I always did is, before I sat down to actually do the work, I wanted to prepare the

10
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,800
scene, I wanted to tidy my desk,

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:01:00,780
I wanted to sharpen my pencils, to make myself a cup of tea, maybe have like a little snack ready. And

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
what I realized is that I was just basically delaying like the actual work.

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,370
And it was just another form of procrastination.

14
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,250
And once I realized that, it also made me think that, you know, by doing all of these little things, like

15
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:29,070
feeding into your perfectionism or your OCD or getting yourself a snack beforehand or just like all

16
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:37,440
of this prep before doing the actual work, it was always like I was rewarding myself for procrastinating

17
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,870
and procrastination.

18
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,240
There's a lot of studies have been done on it and it shows like it's almost like addiction.

19
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,660
It's a.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:56,320
It works so similarly in the human brain to an addiction, in the sense that like, you know, the more you

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,180
feed it the stronger it gets, the more dependent you become on procrastinating.

22
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,620
So one of the best ways is to just not feed it.

23
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:13,070
Imagine it as this sort of monster that you have to really break away from.

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,290
So ever since I realized that, what I did, instead of sort of doing all of these little things beforehand,

25
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,300
is I just got started.

26
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:31,000
And once I was done, once I did the work that I wanted to do, be it revising for an hour or studying something

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,870
for an hour,

28
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,100
itâ€™s at that point that I reward myself, that I get myself a snack or I find something

29
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,360
fun to do for like five minutes.

30
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:51,400
And this really helped me like beat procrastination. And one of the ways that you can try is something

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,940
called the Pomodoro Technique.

32
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,560
So you set the timer for twenty five minutes.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,370
You do the tasks that you're meant to do and then after that time when the timer rings you have a five

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,040
minute break.

35
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,250
And in that five minutes you can do whatever it is you want,

36
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:15,310
right, like you can, you know, like go for a walk, go for a snack, look outside the window, go on like your

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,580
computer, search for something.

38
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:24,190
And the point is that you're delaying all of these fiddly things or all of these little itty bitty things

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,870
for that five minutes.

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:32,170
So while you're working you're fully focused on working and while you're having a break you're fully

41
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,590
focused on having a really relaxing break.

42
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,120
So have a go of that.

43
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:44,490
If you've never tried the Pomodoro Technique, it's pretty pretty big for me anyways.

44
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,590
And I'm really curious how it works out for you.

45
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:54,580
So either let me know in the Q & As, or let me know on Twitter, @yu_angela, how it's

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,090
going for you and what are some of your tricks as well.

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,230
I'm curious to know.

48
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,680
So keep going in the course and I will be silently cheering for you here.
