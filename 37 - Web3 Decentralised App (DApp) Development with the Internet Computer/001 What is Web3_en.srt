00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,030
Hi guys, and welcome to a brand new module in the Web Development Course.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:14,340
Now, if you're wondering what to learn in 2022 and beyond, this is where this module comes in.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,640
So we want to make sure that we're always getting you at the bleeding edge of technology.

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:27,420
So we're introducing this module in collaboration with the Dfinity Foundation, where we're going

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,950
to learn all about blockchain technology and how to develop with blockchain.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,670
Now, a little while ago, I put out a tweet and I asked, "What are you most excited to learn in 2022

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,360
and beyond?"

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:50,520
And this poll was answered by 2,834 people, and it was pretty staggering just how big web3 and blockchain

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,790
has become.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:00,270
And it came out on top with 44.6% of the votes as the technology that people are most excited to learn.

11
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,590
So what we're going to be doing in this module is the latest and greatest in the world of programming

12
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,640
and technology.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,100
And if you're wondering why that is?

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:19,230
Well, this comes from a LinkedIn survey that showed that there was a 12X growth in the number of job

15
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,200
opportunities offered for machine learning engineers.

16
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,820
But the number of job opportunities for blockchain developers grew 33 times which is absolutely massive.

17
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,410
And part of this is because blockchain technology is growing at a rapid rate, and they need more blockchain

18
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,670
developers than ever.

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,350
Which means that the starting salary of somebody who is a junior blockchain developer is somewhere around

20
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,700
$120,000 in the U.S., which means if you're just starting out and you're wondering, should I become

21
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,010
a web developer, a mobile app developer, or a data scientist, it's going to be pretty hard to beat

22
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,639
this kind of starting salary if you become a blockchain developer because they are just so hot and

23
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,250
there's just not enough of them out there right now.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,580
So right now, as of the beginning of 2022, there is a massive amount of growth in the number of active

25
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,880
blockchain developers or web3 developers, and that trend is probably going to continue for the next

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,570
five years.

27
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,770
So what exactly is all of this?

28
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,330
What exactly is Web3 anyways?

29
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,150
Well, it's basically the new internet.

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,530
If you were around in the late 1990s and you heard about all of this Internet fever, what is the Internet?

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,960
How does it work?

32
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,700
And why is everybody throwing lots of money at it?

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,700
Well, that's kind of where we're at with Web3 right now.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,150
There is a massive amount of investment into Web3 technologies, and this is the moment where this technology

35
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,000
is really taking off in a way that is really similar to the beginning of the Internet age.

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,820
But what exactly is it anyways?

37
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:14,730
Well, Web 3.0 describes the third iteration or the third sort of stage of the Web.

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:23,700
Now, Web 1.0 was back in the nineties at the peak of the new Internet, where we were browsing with

39
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,550
Netscape and we were looking at these websites which were basically read-only,

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,910
right?

41
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,470
There was Geocities,

42
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,790
there was Yahoo!, 

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,400
there was Ask Jeeves

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,280
and this really is going to become a test of your age.

45
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,010
But in most of these websites, all you could do is read some information that somebody else put up,

46
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,750
and that's about it.

47
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,610
It was a read-only web.

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
Now, web 2.0 became interactive.

49
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,170
This is your Facebook, your Twitter, your Instagram.

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:03,330
All of these companies came out and built products that let you as the user, interact with them.

51
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,010
So inadvertently, you became the person who was creating the content.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,060
And with all of the users across the world creating content, we built these social networks and we

53
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,640
built the content for all of these websites like TikTok or like Reddit.

54
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,630
And this is kind of the era that we're still in right now where we can read from websites, but we can

55
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,380
also write.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,440
So we're interacting with these websites.

57
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,840
So what is Web 3.0?

58
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:41,940
Well, ever since 2018, people have started building websites and applications on the blockchain,

59
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,600
and this is the dawn of Web 3.0.

60
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,950
Now, you've already heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, but we're not

61
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:59,030
here to talk about Bitcoin or Ethereum or or which cryptos to invest in.

62
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,850
There's plenty of that.

63
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,320
If you search for cryptocurrency on YouTube, you're going to get loads of people giving you dubious

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,590
recommendations about what to buy, what to not buy.

65
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,510
Now, if you think you can predict the future, then this is probably the path to go down.

66
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,150
But as developers, we can control the future, so we don't have to predict it.

67
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,050
Instead, we can build what Web3 will become.

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,300
And you can take a look at some of these awesome things that have been built on Web3.

69
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:35,050
For example, Helium is a really popular Web3 project, which is providing wireless internet to out

70
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,670
of the way places through individual people hosting their 5G network and owning cryptocurrency. Or Pool

71
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:48,910
Together, which lets you participate in no loss lotteries.

72
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,760
Now, even though it sounds like gambling, it's actually a very clever way of tricking you into saving

73
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,180
money.

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,950
This is a web3 application that takes everybody's money that they pledge and earns interest on the total

75
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,220
and then pays out the interest to one lucky winner.

76
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:12,010
But that means that the original money that you put in never gets lost, and you can withdraw your savings

77
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,420
at any time or build games on the blockchain like Axie Infinity, where people are actually giving up

78
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,360
their day jobs and playing this game where they're earning more than what they would in their local

79
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,990
currency.

80
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,790
So what is it anyways?

81
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:35,530
Well, Axie Infinity is a pokemon-like game, but the most important part is it allows you to buy and

82
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,450
sell and trade your axies.

83
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,100
And every single time one of these trades happen, the developers will take a 4.25% cut.

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,910
So if you look at the sales volumes, just for the last 24 hours, there's already been almost 3 million

85
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,650
worth of trades happening.

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,910
So if we calculate that, so that's 3 million times 0.0425,

87
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,860
so the developers have made somewhere around 127,000 in the last 24 hours, which is probably more than

88
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,930
some mainstream triple-A games.

89
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,580
And this really is just the beginning of what we're seeing in Web3.

90
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:22,090
The potential is huge, and this is one of the biggest opportunities in 2022 and beyond.

91
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,790
And this is something that I'm so excited to teach you about and we're going to learn about in the coming

92
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,050
lessons of this module.

93
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,690
But first, in order to make Web3 applications, we first have to understand how the blockchain works.

94
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,570
So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson.
