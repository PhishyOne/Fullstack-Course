1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,370
Now, first things first.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,670
In order to get started, we need to install the required tools and do some setup of those tools in

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,220
order to start development on the Internet computer.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,290
Now, I've listed all of these steps together for you in a handy Google doc, and if you look inside

5
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:25,680
this current Udemy lesson, you'll see a link to this published on the internet so you can follow along

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,090
with me step by step.

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,080
There's a couple of things that you need to copy and paste, so I really recommend using it.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,610
If you are a Windows user, then you can skip this video and head over to the next one where I've got

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,820
all the instructions specifically for Windows.

10
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,220
Now the first step you should already have done, which is to install Node.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,390
We covered Node extensively in this course and in all likelihood you probably already have it installed.

12
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,750
But if you don't simply click on this link and head over to the website and download this one on the

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,810
left. It's really important that you download the LTS, which stands for long term support rather than

14
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,510
the one with the latest features, because the Internet computer will only work with the long term support.

15
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:21,150
Now, if you already have node installed, I recommend just doing a quick version check using node -

16
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,050
-version and hopefully it's 16 or above.

17
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,920
If not, again, go over here and just download the latest version.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,600
Now the next thing you're going to need is a DFX.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,570
So this is the way that we're going to be able to work with the entire computer locally to be able to

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,600
deploy our applications and to run our code.

21
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,640
So firstly, we're going to need to open up the terminal app, which you saw me open just now already.

22
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,030
If you don't know how to do that, simply head over to spotlight and search for terminal and open it

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,240
up.

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,140
Now we're going to copy this command wholesale as it is, and be careful that you don't drop any of

25
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,270
these double quotes at the end or anything.

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,820
Just select it in its entirety.

27
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,420
And then I want you to paste this as an entire line into your terminal and hit Enter.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Now, the installation process will take a little while, but once it's done and your DFX is successfully

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:27,270
installed, you'll be able to check and confirm this by writing dfx ---version and it should

30
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,990
give you a version of 0.9.3.

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,960
Now the final thing you need to do is to download the latest version of VSCode if you haven't already.

32
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,510
And this is a popular code editor, and we're choosing VSCode in this case because it has the tooling

33
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,800
to work with Motoko and to be able to develop for the Internet computer.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,970
So just go ahead and download and install if you haven't already got it.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,710
Now the final step in all of this setup is to install the Motoko VSCode extension.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,790
And you can either do that by searching for it inside VSCode or simply heading over to this link that

37
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,750
I've got for you,

38
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,010
clicking install and it should take you straight through to VSCode

39
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,240
where you can install it.

40
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,080
Just make sure that if you are searching for the extension that you actually got the one that is called

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,860
Motoko from the Dfinity Foundation, because there's quite a few other ones that are named in a similar

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,340
fashion.

43
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,670
But there you have it.

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,540
You're now ready to build your very first Internet computer application.

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,930
Our, testing ground, our

46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,190
Hello World App.

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,880
But the first thing we're going to do before we get started is to create a dedicated project folder.

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,300
So what I've got is something called ic-project, Internet computer projects, in my files.

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,150
And it's really handy to have this so that you can keep all the projects in the same place and keep

50
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,350
it nicely organized.

51
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,030
So I recommend going to your desktop, hitting the command button and hitting the up button in order

52
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,820
to get to your users of root folder.

53
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,589
And you can create the new folder ic-projects right here.

54
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,180
Now, once you've created your folder, I want you to go ahead and open up terminal and we're going

55
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,560
to navigate to that new folder by writing cd and then dragging that folder into the terminal and

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,370
hitting enter.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,570
Now we're inside this project folder where we're going to run that command that you see here.

58
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,910
So I'm just going to copy it wholesale and then paste it into my terminal and hit enter.

59
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,540
Now it's going to go through the process of creating a new Internet computer project, which comes by

60
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,430
default with some sample code.

61
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,490
And it functions as a Hello World project.

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Now you'll know it's done once you see the Dfinity logo and we're now going to open up this new project

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,200
inside VSCode.

64
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:14,880
So go ahead into VSCode and click on Open and then select that project folder inside the ic-projects

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,370
folder that you created and click open.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,870
And now you should be able to see all of the code that was automatically created, including some Motoko

67
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,700
code and also some HTML and JavaScript.

68
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:37,020
So now we're going to try and deploy this project following the step by step instructions.

69
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,950
So go ahead and open up a new terminal and I want you to write dfx

70
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:49,410
start and this is going to start the local Internet computer.

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,050
And once you see something like info starting server listing on something, something, something,

72
00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,560
then you're ready to go ahead and split out another terminal window by clicking on this button right

73
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,690
here. And inside this other terminal window, you're going to write dfx deploy in order to deploy this

74
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,560
new project onto the local Internet computer network.

75
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,940
Now that's going to take just a little while.

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:23,430
But once it's done, you can go ahead and run npm start to start your server. And if you scroll up,

77
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,310
it actually tells you where your project is running.

78
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,870
So you can copy this

79
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,400
URL and paste it into your browser in order to see your brand new intact computer dapp.

80
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:42,060
So you can enter your name here and click on the button and it should greet you by your name.

81
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,570
So super simple, but if you manage to get here and get this running, then that means all of the installation

82
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,520
and setup has been completed successfully and you are now ready to start writing some code.

83
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:59,670
So go ahead and skip the next lesson, which is installation set up for Windows users and head straight

84
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,300
on to begin making your very first Internet computer project.
