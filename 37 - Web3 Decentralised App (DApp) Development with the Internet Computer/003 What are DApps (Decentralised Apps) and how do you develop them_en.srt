1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,530
So now that we know what Dapps or decentralized applications are, let's talk about how we can actually

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,530
create them and what new opportunities they offer us.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,010
So as we mentioned, dapps are the backbone of Web3.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,680
This is how we're going to bring about the next iteration of the Internet by creating these decentralized

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,490
applications.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,660
And this brings about a huge change in the way that companies are formed and new tech startups are built.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,810
For example, in the old way, you'd first build your start-up, build the technology, deploy it,

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,450
and then raise VC funding.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,950
Hopefully they like your idea and they like your product.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,160
And then you would at some point down the line, if you're really lucky, maybe IPO and cash out.

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,660
Now in the new Web3 way, we're looking at something that completely flips this model of creating

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,950
businesses on its head.

13
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,140
In this case, you're building your startup, you're building the technology, but then you can already

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:06,000
start releasing tokens to the public or to funds like VCs, and you can start selling tokens that enable

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,880
people to use and interact your technology.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,750
And you're able to start raising money for your dapp from day one.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,360
And the way that you run your company is also transformed by the blockchain because you can form what's

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,600
called these decentralized autonomous organizations, which kind of replaces the board of directors

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,900
as well as the entire organizational chart of a company.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,490
So you can have people who are token holders.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,910
They're special tokens called governance tokens, which allows you to vote on what the company or

22
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,970
the dapp should do in the future.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,860
So in these DAOs, you're able to start controlling how the company functions and you allow users to

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,850
contribute to the roadmap of your decentralized application.

25
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,450
And in a way, everybody's incentives are aligned, because if this application does really well, then

26
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,330
the token price will go up,

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,720
it'll become more valuable.

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:10,530
And in order to do that, the company has to do valuable things, which means that you have to make

29
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,430
good decisions.

30
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,370
So everybody in the DAOs is incentivized to participate and try and help the organization along.

31
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,540
Now, what does it mean for you as an individual entrepreneur?

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,880
Now, let's say that you decided to build Dropbox and you build a really great product.

33
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,940
You raise a series A funding

34
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,370
after coming out of Y Combinator, you are literally the hottest thing on the block and you managed

35
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,010
to raise a total of $6 million.

36
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,070
And this at the time was really, really huge.

37
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,350
It was a really successful fundraising round for Dropbox.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,440
Now, if you don't know what Dropbox is, it's basically a way for you to store your files off of your

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,350
computer on the cloud, somewhere else, so that you're able to access it no matter where you are.

40
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,310
Kind of like Google Drive today.

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,300
So Dropbox has this amazing funding round.

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,800
But let's compare that to a Web3 competitor. Filecoin does pretty much similar to what Dropbox

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,160
does.

44
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,650
It allows you to store all your files in a decentralized way in the cloud,

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,770
but instead of having it hosted by a single company, namely Dropbox, it's actually hosted across millions

46
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,720
of computers across the Internet.

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:28,050
And that way you have a massive amount of redundancy and you able to retrieve your file no matter where

48
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,540
you are, as long as you have access to the Internet.

49
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,050
Now, they raised an initial coin offering, which is where they allowed the public to buy up their

50
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,360
coins, which they had minted.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:48,720
And in this initial coin offering, they managed to raise $257 million, which makes Dropbox's $6 million

52
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,000
suddenly look very, very little.

53
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:59,040
So when you're creating decentralized apps, you're able to raise funding earlier and oftentimes raise

54
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,350
even more than through traditional means, like going to venture capitalists or going to angel investors.

55
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,810
And the future of decentralized applications is really exciting.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,279
Anything you can imagine that revolves around a trustless system that is decentralized, that allows

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,670
both the users as well as the creators to benefit, can be achieved.

58
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,250
So, for example, instead of having Uber drivers being ripped off by Uber, you could have user-and-

59
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:36,180
driver owned version of Uber, where everybody who is driving for the company or using the company to

60
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:43,440
get around is able to get access to the tokens to govern, to determine, how the company should be

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,220
run and also effectively own shares in that company

62
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,800
once it gets more and more successful. You can also realize crazy ideas like you could have racing

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,410
games on the internet and everybody puts in, you know, maybe a dollar in order to participate in the

64
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,590
game and then at the

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,240
end of the game, you have cash prizes going towards those who have won the game.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,160
Now, another really massive benefit of Web3 is pseudonymity.

67
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,290
This idea that you can be identified by a handle or by a username, where you can have your privacy,

68
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,580
you don't have to reveal your real name or your address or where you live, but you can create things

69
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,390
that benefit other people and be recognized and rewarded by your pseudonym.

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,710
And this is a great equalizer because it means it doesn't matter who you are, what race you are, what

71
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,050
gender you are, how old you are,

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,820
you're able to be recognized for what you do rather than who you are.

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,320
For example, I saw this article in Forbes where they interviewed three teenagers who created a decentralized

74
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:53,230
finance project called Rari Capital, which makes lending and borrowing on blockchain easier.

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,390
And they're only 18 or 19.

76
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,980
Imagine trying to get VC funding when you're only 18 and you haven't even gone to university.

77
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,990
And when these guys started out building on the blockchain, they were actually only 16.

78
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,470
And I remember how hard it was to be taken seriously when I was 15 or 16, whenever I had to call somebody

79
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,600
or when I had to show up somewhere

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,820
and they they sort of looked at you like, you are so young, like, what could you possibly know?

81
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,670
But instead, you know, with pseudonymity, you can build for the web3 and it doesn't matter

82
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,540
if you're 12

83
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,900
as long as you're able to produce valuable things, people will recognize and respect you and you can

84
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,680
raise funding and be judged only on your work.

85
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,090
So now I hope you're ready and pumped to start building Dapps.

86
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,590
So where do we start?

87
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,070
Well, the first thing you'll encounter is you have to make a choice.

88
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,160
You have to pick a chain to build on.

89
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,570
Do you go for Avalanche or Polkadot or Solana?

90
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,800
How do you choose?

91
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:59,980
Well, currently the largest number of dapps are built on Ethereum

92
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,500
and this is just because it was the first one around.

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,860
It was the first chain which had these smart contracts, and you can write code that can be embedded

94
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,510
into the blockchain.

95
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,840
But Etherium has a number of fundamental problems that prevents it from being a good choice for creating

96
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,070
Dapps for web3.

97
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,070
And the biggest problem is scaling.

98
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:28,270
You can't store data on Ethereum, and it's very costly to perform computation on the Ethereum network.

99
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,170
So, for example, Nfts, which are minted on Ethereum, are not even stored on the blockchain.

100
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,370
Instead, what you get is a URL and the actual data, the actual image for the NFT is stored somewhere

101
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,240
else. That somewhere else could be using ipfs through file coin

102
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,910
but often the images for an NFT are just stored on a company's private servers owned by, say, Amazon

103
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,530
AWS.

104
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,200
So the biggest problems with developing decentralized applications on Ethereum is the fact that it's

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,690
very costly to do computation on there.

106
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,860
It's very costly to store anything on there, and it's nearly impossible to actually have a proper back

107
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,470
end with a database, which is why a lot of decentralized applications running on Ethereum are actually

108
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,050
made up of a patchwork of different services.

109
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,260
For example, even the website follows a dapps with all their CSS, JavaScript and images are usually

110
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,960
hosted on Amazon AWS.

111
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,650
So this is where the Internet computer comes in.

112
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:38,350
Back in even 2014, where most of us were not really aware of the blockchain or how it works, or even

113
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,450
had the smarts to buy a bitcoin,

114
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,800
the team at Dfinity started building the internet computer and the idea is to build a scalable cloud

115
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
computer that runs on a blockchain.

116
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:57,160
So it has all of the benefits of a trustless decentralized system, but also it allows you to perform

117
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:05,020
fast computations, store data directly on the blockchain and to be able to create fully-fledged applications

118
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,620
on chain.

119
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,750
So this is what we're going to be working with in this module to create decentralized applications.

120
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,030
And in the next lesson, I'm going to talk a bit more about how it works and how we can get started

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,070
building decentralized apps on it.
