00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,130
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,740
In this lesson, we're going to be learning all about the Express Framework, the framework that's built

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,240
on top of Node that's going to help us create our backends with ease.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:18,680
Now, even when we're looking at the entire world of frameworks, Express comes ranking pretty high

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,860
amongst the professional developers.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:27,950
And so we're going to see what exactly this framework is and why it's loved and used by so many developers.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,860
Previously, I mentioned that there are many languages that you can use on the back end, and these

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,170
are the programming languages,

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,080
but in addition to languages, there are also a bunch of frameworks that you can choose.

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:50,690
Now, I mentioned that the framework that uses JavaScript is Node, but strictly speaking, Node is actually

11
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,400
not a framework,

12
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,450
instead it's a runtime environment.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:03,390
Now we mentioned previously that what a runtime environment means is it allows us to run JavaScript

14
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,330
on the computer.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:14,610
So Node is what enables us to use JavaScript on a computer and not just limited to within the browser.

16
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:21,780
Now Express, on the other hand, is actually a JavaScript framework that allows us to create backends

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:29,580
for our websites and with the powers of Node and Express combined is how most professional developers

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,710
build their website backends.

19
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,010
Why do we need Express anyways?

20
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,540
Because Node is too powerful and all encompassing.

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:46,140
You can use Node to do a lot of things because all it is is it allows us to run JavaScript on any computer

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,130
and this means that it can be used to do many things.

23
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:58,200
And indeed, yes, it is mostly used for web development to create the back-end for our websites,

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,150
but in addition, you can also use Node to maybe program your IoT device, your Internet of Things device.

25
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,220
Maybe you want a smart toaster that tweets at you and the toast is done,

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,240
because these days it seems like that's what IoT is all about.

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:21,240
But you can also use Node to maybe make desktop apps and in fact VS Code, which you've been using all

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:30,060
this time is created using Node.js, and it's the Node that allows this desktop application to run on your

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,390
computer as you've been using it right now. As we mentioned that you can use Node to do a lot of

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,840
things

31
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,830
and when we have a tool or a language that allows us to do many things, it generally is not very specialized

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,060
for one thing.

33
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,690
And right now the one thing and the one thing only that we're interested in is creating a website

34
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,200
back-end.

35
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:00,720
If you imagine Node as a Phillips screwdriver, it's the tool that allows us to use JavaScript on any

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,090
computer, not just within the browser,

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,660
then this tool is pretty great and it's pretty universal.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,010
It allows us to do many, many tasks using JavaScript.

39
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,710
But I don't know if you've ever built anything with IKEA, but lately, I'm moving house and I'm building

40
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:23,790
a lot of IKEA furniture and I sort of started giving myself repetitive strain injury by trying to use

41
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,980
the Allen Key and the screwdriver to build, you know, like a Pax wardrobe or like a BILLY bookcase.

42
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,270
And then I finally gave up and I bought an electric screwdriver

43
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,760
and then my entire life changed.

44
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,850
In fact, if you are building IKEA furniture, that is a level three difficulty or above,

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,690
you should probably buy an electric screwdriver.

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,060
I know this is a programming course, but you know, this is a really important life lesson.

47
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,250
So in our case, Express is kind of like that electric screwdriver.

48
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,760
It allows us to use JavaScript and Node to create our website back end, but it is souped up and it

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,060
makes the whole thing so much quicker and so much easier.

50
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,920
Don't take my word for it.

51
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,279
Let's take a look at the code written using just Node to create a very simple website.

52
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:25,950
It's got a homepage, it's got an About Us page, and that's basically all our website has. In order to

53
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:34,260
do this using just Node, this is all of the code that you have to write yourself and it's a little

54
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,180
bit cumbersome and it's a little bit complicated and it's really hard for somebody to look at this code

55
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,650
straight away and know exactly what is going on.

56
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,820
Now let's compare this exact same website, but this time we're building it using Express and Node.

57
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:58,050
In this case, we are importing, Express and Express will interface with all the Node parts for us.

58
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,610
And look at this code.

59
00:04:59,610 --> 00:04:59,810
Look at

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,740
how beautifully laid out it is and look at how modular each part is and how easy it is to understand

61
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,140
what's going on in all the different parts.

62
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,990
Now, in the last module, I could have of course, made you write out all of this in order to create

63
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,120
our first website using Node,

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,930
but this is almost on a level of torture and entirely unnecessary because no web developer will create

65
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,790
a website using just Node.

66
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:30,220
In almost all the cases, when we're creating a backend using node, we're going to be using Express.

67
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,570
Because of all these advantages; we get better readability,

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,760
we have to write less code,

69
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,330
we have the ability to add middleware, which I'll explain to you very soon what it is and how it acts

70
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,450
almost like Lego to enable us to choose which features we want to add to our website backend.

71
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,020
With all of these advantages plus more, it's no wonder that it's so popular amongst JavaScript backend

72
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,340
developers, even though if you've ever heard of a JavaScript framework, you'll know that there is

73
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,560
a massive amount of debate all the time, which is the best frontend framework, which is the best

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,240
backend framework, which is the best authentication framework, etcetera, etcetera.

75
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,170
But this is the one time where it's actually really easy to pick a JavaScript framework. When you're

76
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:24,260
working with Node and you're creating a website back end, a professional developer will choose the

77
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,290
Express framework because as you'll soon see, it is the best choice and it makes our lives a lot easier.

78
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,600
And also it might even spark joy.

79
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,460
And this is backed up with data.

80
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,340
So if you look at the state of JavaScript statistics, there is 100% no doubt which framework you should

81
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,820
be using when you're working with Node to generate your backend.

82
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,060
So now that we've seen what Express.js is and why it's chosen by professional developers the world over.

83
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,360
The next thing to do is to actually use it and create our very first website backend.

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,570
So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson.
