00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,920
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,780
In this section, we're going to be learning about the Bootstrap Framework.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:13,670
And this is one of many external CSS layout systems, but this is probably one of the most popular and

4
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,030
the one that you'll most likely to come across out in the wild.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:26,030
Bootstrap, as I said, is a CSS framework created in 2010 by two Twitter developers Mark Otto and Jacob

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,780
Thornton.

7
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,100
Now the power of Bootstrap and the reason why it became so popular is it contained pre-made CSS files,

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,820
which you can simply include into your project in order to use their pre-built components and styling.

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,790
For example, if you wanted to have some tags in your website, you could create a look like this by

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,400
simply adding a few classes to your HTML.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,150
On top of that, one of the biggest reasons why Bootstrap took off is because of their 12-column layout

12
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,520
system built on top of Flexbox

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,820
that makes it really easy to create responsive websites and websites that simply just work and look

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,130
great on mobile as well as desktop, the so-called mobile-first approach.

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,320
So how exactly does it work?

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,120
Well, let's say you had a button which just said "Home", 

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,580
you can see that the standard button rendered from HTML doesn't look fantastic.

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,040
But if we included just five classes which come from the Bootstrap CSS, so we include the pre-built

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:39,570
CSS into our project and we add the styling and the components by adding these classes to our HTML,

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,340
then all of a sudden what you'll end up with is something that looks beautiful and pre-styled like this.

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,880
And because we don't have to worry about writing all of the CSS code, all we need to know is which

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,670
classes we need to add to our HTML.

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,730
Then it makes everything so much easier and so much quicker when we want to build components into our

24
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,450
website.

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,940
Now, as I mentioned, bootstrap is a type of CSS framework,

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,840
what exactly are these?

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,150
Well, they're pre-made CSS files which you can include into your projects.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,910
If we had a look at the bootstrap GitHub and because bootstrap is completely open source, then all

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:30,750
of the code is visible and you can see it's got styling defined for all of the different components.

30
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:38,640
For example, this is inside the Card Component and it's got classes that define what a card-body should

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,880
look like, what kind of layout it should have, what kind of color it should have, as well as what

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,000
the card title should look like, subtitle,

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,780
and it's got all of this predefined CSS, which we can simply insert straight into our HTML.

34
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,010
Now, the two most popular external CSS frameworks are bootstrap and foundation, but there are lots

35
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,210
more like MUI and Tailwind and a whole bunch more.

36
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,220
And the reason why they're so great is because they allow us to add in pre-built components and develop

37
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,950
websites quickly and efficiently.

38
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:21,480
If we look at the usage percentages across the Internet, you can see that the biggest CSS external

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,340
framework is still Bootstrap with close to 80% of the market share.

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,850
But just because we learn about bootstrap, it doesn't mean that everything we learned about CSS is

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,600
null and void.

42
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,440
In fact, if you look at the top here, when we look at the absolute usage percentages of all of the

43
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,200
different frameworks across the Internet, you can see the largest percentage are still websites that

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,440
don't use any external CSS frameworks.

45
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,160
What does it mean when there are no CSS frameworks being used?

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,250
Well, it means you're probably using native CSS like Flexbox and Grid and Float and all of the great

47
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,610
things that we learnt before.

48
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:06,420
So bootstrap doesn't replace any of that knowledge and in fact we should be in a situation where we

49
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,290
don't actually need to depend on any sort of external framework, but they are really useful when we

50
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,890
want to develop websites quickly and easily and we don't want to spend a ton of time designing our websites

51
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,470
because it comes with all of the pre-made styling and all of the styling rules that we can easily conform

52
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,510
to by using their components.

53
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,260
So what are the pros of external CSS frameworks?

54
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,710
Well, they're easy and they're fast to use and you get a ton of pre-built components like this pricing

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,770
plan, which took us ages to build ourselves.

56
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,370
And you also get really consistent styling across your website.

57
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:51,090
It's almost like you hired a professional developer who kept everything looking on brand and finally

58
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:57,060
you have really good browser compatibility because they've tested all of the different browsers Safari,

59
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,370
Chrome, Brave and whichever browsers that

60
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,770
your user might be using.

61
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,270
So you don't actually have to do all of this complicated testing.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,070
You can just trust that it works out of the box.

63
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,510
Now, what are some of the downsides of CSS Frameworks?

64
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,850
Well, one of the biggest downsides is something called class bloat.

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,390
Remember previously we mentioned that it's a really good idea to separate structure from style, where

66
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,570
we said that HTML is for structure.

67
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:33,170
So adding in elements that describe what the purpose is, and CSS is for style. Using external CSS frameworks

68
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:39,380
because we're adding everything into the classes, then very quickly you end up with what's called class

69
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,570
bloat, where you have a lot of styling going into the actual HTML file and it looks a lot less clean

70
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,450
than if we had just use something like Grid or Flexbox, where we have all of our predefined classes and

71
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,400
we go easy on the classes that we add in to our HTML file.

72
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,910
The other downside is customization.

73
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,060
If you want to build a website where you want to have full control over every pixel and layout and everything

74
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,680
to be exactly the way you designed it, then external CSS frameworks is probably not the way to go because

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,630
in order to customize each and every component, it can be really time consuming.

76
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,340
So when should you use the CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and when should you not?

77
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:35,520
Well, when you are building a mobile-first responsive website that you want to put online very quickly

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,730
and access beautiful components designed by professional designers, keeping everything on your website

79
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,640
looking slick and uniform, then you probably want to consider using bootstrap.

80
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:53,520
But if you're building a very simple website where you just need HTML and CSS and you can quickly throw

81
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,630
it up, or if you're building a really complex custom design website and you want complete control over

82
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,500
the design, then it's probably not a good idea to use an external CSS framework like Bootstrap.

83
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:13,290
So we've spoken so much about the pros and cons, when to use, when not to use, but how do you actually

84
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:13,890
use it?

85
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,460
Well, one of the easiest ways is to include it via a CDN link.

86
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,220
We've seen how we can use the link tag in order to add our stylesheets,

87
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:31,560
and in a similar way, we can use these link tags that simply gets hold of the stylesheet from an external

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,370
resource.

89
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,760
So in this case it's through CDN, which stands for Content Delivery Network.

90
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:47,610
And what these are is little hubs all across the entire world and it knows where your users are located.

91
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,000
So when they load up your website and try to access this particular CSS file that contains all of the

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,690
bootstrap code, then it can find the closest location with the shortest distance to the server that

93
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,070
has that content.

94
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,320
And that just means that even though this has to be downloaded from somewhere, it can be delivered

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,740
to your user and rendered very, very quickly.

96
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,550
And from our point of view as developers, all we need to do is simply include this link into the head

97
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,740
section of our HTML.

98
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,520
And if we want any of the functionality like dropdown menus or clickable buttons, then we want to include

99
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,920
the bootstrap script just before the end of the body section.

100
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,740
So somewhere right about here.

101
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:42,900
Now let's go ahead and try an exercise and see if we can upgrade our website quickly by using bootstrap.

102
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:51,060
Download 11.0 Bootstrap Intro, and if you open it inside of VS Code, open the index.html, you can see

103
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,090
there are four TODO's for you to complete.

104
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:01,740
And once you've completed all of these four steps, you should end up with a card that displays a sunflower

105
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,340
image.

106
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,300
And this is one of the pre-built bootstrap components.

107
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,970
Now how are you going to do this?

108
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:15,390
Well, firstly, you're going to head over to getbootstrap.com, which is the main bootstrap website,

109
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,030
and then I want you to include the bootstrap files using CDN.

110
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,010
You only need the CSS file through this link element for now.

111
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,160
And then I want you to go into the documentation if you want to look up anything regarding the Card

112
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,970
Component, which is all the way down here in Components under the Card Section.

113
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,940
Now you know what the goal should look like.

114
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,250
You've got all of the resources to get started and you should be able to work through each of the TODOs

115
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,690
one by one.

116
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,260
Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.

117
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,150
All right.

118
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:05,230
Hopefully, you've given that a go and you've seen that the Bootstrap Card has some example code, which

119
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,900
you can straight up just drop into your file.

120
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,210
If you haven't given this a go, pause the video now.

121
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,050
Don't continue because things will get harder and harder as we go on in the course,

122
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,050
and if you just watch the videos, eventually, at some point things are not going to make sense because

123
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,610
you haven't had the practice.

124
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,610
Make things easy for your future self by putting in lots of effort and practice now.

125
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,500
All right, enough said.

126
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,900
First thing, let's walk through the solution together and hopefully you can check it against your work.

127
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,240
Now the first thing we're going to do is add the bootstrap link, which comes from the homepage,

128
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,970
and we just want this first link that is going to include the stylesheet.

129
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,260
And you can see this is a link with a relationship of stylesheet.

130
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,100
So instead of using our own stylesheet, we're now using the bootstrap CSS.

131
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,640
And if you're wondering what that "min" stands for, it's basically a file where all of the spaces are

132
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,630
taken away so that it's as short as possible.

133
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,000
So it loads up quicker because there's no spaces and everything's all jumbled, which is impossible

134
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,080
for humans to read,

135
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,020
but it works just fine for the computer.

136
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,670
TODO Number 2 is to add the bootstrap pre-built card.

137
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:29,690
So if we go into our docs and find our Card Component, you can see the first example is pretty much

138
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,120
the card we want to build.

139
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,790
If we look at the goal, we've got our Card title, some example text, a button and an image, and

140
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,700
this is exactly the same as this example.

141
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,950
So let's copy the HTML and paste it into here under TODO Number 2.

142
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,350
Now let's check our work, let's show it in preview and see what it looks like.

143
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,430
It looks pretty good

144
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,570
other than the fact that the image is pretty much completely broken.

145
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:02,840
So step three is to change the image source to display the flower JPEG image.

146
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:10,510
The image is right here and right now the source is completely empty because it's an example.

147
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,230
Let's go ahead and change it to our image, which is flower.jpeg.

148
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:21,590
You see it show up immediately and as always with images, let's add an alt text so that people with

149
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,780
screen readers know what it's all about.

150
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,740
All right.

151
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:32,690
Now the final step is a little bit of a revision step because I wanted you to use Flexbox to center

152
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:35,870
the card in the vertical and horizontal center.

153
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:42,230
If we take a look at this URL on our browser, you can see it's stuck all the way to the top left,

154
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,990
which is default HTML layout,

155
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,600
but if we want it right here in the middle, then we're going to need to use some Flexbox magic and

156
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,240
we're going to do that inside an internal style element right here under TODO Number 4.

157
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,420
What do we need to target?

158
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,310
Well, we need to target the entire card,

159
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,790
and the topmost level is this "flex-container."

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,310
The reason why it's of class, flex-container, is because this comes from the Bootstrap CSS and it's got

161
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,270
some styling in there that defines that container,

162
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,910
but we can always override it.

163
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,580
And this is really, really important when we want to override a particular bootstrap style, we have

164
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,160
to make sure that it's more specific.

165
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:36,740
So either it goes inside an internal style element or it goes inside an inline style property, or if

166
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:44,420
we're using our standard external CSS and we use a link linking to, I don't know, say,

167
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,890
./css/style.css and we have style.css file somewhere in our project, then you've got to make sure

168
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:58,130
that your custom CSS file occurs below the bootstrap link.

169
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:06,350
That way this is first looked at and then the browser looks at your custom style sheet and you can override

170
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,410
any of the classes that come from bootstrap.

171
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,720
So this is an important point to remember for the future when you're creating your own custom style

172
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,320
sheets.

173
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:21,680
All right, so now in order to override the style here, now we might be building on top of existing

174
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,270
bootstrap styles or we might be specifying something they don't even care about, and it's not defined

175
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,340
in the bootstrap CSS at all.

176
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,450
In our case, we want to change this flex container to "display: flex" because we know that this is one

177
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:39,980
of the simplest ways to center anything in CSS.

178
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,770
And the first thing we need to change is the justify-content set to center,

179
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,790
and the second one is align-items set to center,

180
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:56,660
and finally, we need to make sure that the entire container takes up the full height and not just some

181
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:56,860
proportion

182
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,830
of the height

183
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,960
that's enough for the content.

184
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,740
So let's set the height to 100vh,

185
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:11,460
and now you can see our card is perfectly centered in the middle using Flexbox.

186
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:18,330
It's a component that we've borrowed and customized from Bootstrap, and you can see how easy it was,

187
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,460
and quick to create this layout by leveraging the power of Bootstrap.

188
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,660
In the next lesson, we're going to dive deeper into bootstrap and we're going to look at how the bootstrap.

189
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,040
12-column layout system actually works in practice.

190
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,150
So for all of that and more, I'll see you in the next lesson.
