00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,689
Hey guys, welcome to the Introduction to CSS Section.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:10,430
And in this very first lesson, we're going to be introducing you to CSS.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:16,760
You'll be learning what it is, how it works and why we need it to be able to style our websites and

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,740
make them look beautiful.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,470
What exactly is CSS?

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,610
Well, it stands for "Cascading Style Sheets."

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,270
It kind of conjures up the image of a cascade.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:29,570
Right? 

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,540
And a cascade is simply like a waterfall.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,880
You have water at one level that then drops down through a waterfall into another level.

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,940
And we're going to see as we start to use these cascading style sheets, why that analogy is so apt.

12
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,960
Because the way that the style is applied cascades like a waterfall.

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:59,000
We start from the most general all the way down to the most specific styling requirements, and we're

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,560
going to see that in use as we use these cascading style sheets.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,550
The other part of this name is the, "style sheet."

16
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:17,150
A style sheet is a type of language similar to how we had the HTML, which is a markup language,

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,810
that's what the "ML" part of HTML stands for.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,150
We have the style sheet, which is what the "SS" part stands for, and this is a language that allows

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,200
us to specify how things should look in our website.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,770
And there are many different types of stylesheet languages.

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,710
The one that's most important and what we're going to be learning all about in this section is the cascading

22
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,340
style sheet.

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:52,520
But there's also others like Sass, which stands for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet and Less, which

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,110
stands for Leaner CSS and many, many others.

25
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:03,530
But the most important one that every web developer needs to know is CSS.

26
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,990
And that's what we're going to be focusing on today.

27
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,770
So why did we need CSS?

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,030
Where did it come from and what exactly is the history of this whole thing?

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:20,820
Well, in the very beginning when the Internet was very, very new, there was no CSS, there was only

30
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,800
HTML.

31
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:28,350
And one of the things that developers started wanting to do is they wanted to style their website and

32
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,830
make it look the way they wanted it to, but they were really, really limited by HTML.

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:42,780
And this is a now famous email sent by Marc Andreessen, who is the founder of Mosaic, which is one

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,320
of the earliest Internet browsers who later founded Netscape and now the very famous Andreessen Horowitz

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,550
VC Fund.

36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,270
And in this email he famously said that the answer he has for so many developers who want to simply

37
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,810
control what their documents look like, meaning what their websites look like in a way that would be

38
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,880
trivial, say in Microsoft Word,

39
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,330
his answer to these developers is just, "Sorry, you're screwed."

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,430
There is no way to do it very easily at that point in HTML.

41
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,490
That's why all the website looks pretty much the same,

42
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,390
pretty boring,

43
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,460
and there was no variation.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,930
So what happened next?

45
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:31,140
Well, the W3C consortium responded by releasing a new version of HTML, HTML 3.2, and this came out

46
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,040
in 1997, so it was still in the very early days of the Internet.

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:44,700
And what this 3.2 HTML allowed was it introduced new HTML tags such as the font tag, which allows you

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,870
to define the font size, the color and the font face.

49
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,950
So the type of font you would want to use for your document.

50
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,630
Similarly, there was also the color attribute for font.

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,670
There was the face attribute, the size attribute, and these attributes allow you to change all sorts

52
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,360
of things about the way the text looks on your website.

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,340
And then there was also the center element which allows you to format your document and define how it

54
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,380
would be laid out on the screen.

55
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,680
Now, what you'll notice in all three of these Web pages is the deprecated symbol next to it.

56
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,380
All of these are deprecated, which in programming lingo, simply means you should no longer be using

57
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,140
these attributes and elements.

58
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:41,730
And the reason for this is because, as you can imagine, HTML is supposed to be for content.

59
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,710
Now, if you add in a ton of styling into all of that content, you tell the website how it should be

60
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,400
centered, how it should be laid out, how the font should look, what color it should be, what kind

61
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,680
of border your tables should have, and a whole bunch of other styling effectively,

62
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,990
then this is going to massively clutter up all of your HTML.

63
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,600
And you can imagine this is a really, really short website and it's already got so much junk in it

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,510
that we can't really tell what exactly is the structure and the content of the website and

65
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,560
if you extend this to a larger website and you just want to do some simple things like give it some

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,270
colors or put things into the center, then your whole HTML file is going to be many, many, many thousands

67
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,790
of lines long and it's impossible to differentiate the content from the styling.

68
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,340
So what happened next?

69
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:52,250
Well, in 1996, a new recommendation was proposed by the W3 consortium, and this was led by Hakon

70
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:52,940
Wium.

71
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,180
*struggles with pronunciation*

72
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,980
*struggles with pronunciation*

73
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,250
And he's basically the father of the Cascading Style Sheet.

74
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,540
And what this recommendation allows us to do is to allows us to attach styles such as font colors and

75
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,380
spacing to our HTML documents.

76
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,890
And this is the breakthrough that allowed us to separate our styling from our content.

77
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:31,110
And as in many different situations, a separation of concerns so that somebody is responsible for putting

78
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,750
together the car headlights and somebody else is responsible for dealing with the wheels rather than

79
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,590
one person making an entire car,

80
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,710
this kind of modularity, as you'll see in coming lessons, is super important, not just in manufacturing

81
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,830
and in real life, but also in programming.

82
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,450
If you want to see what CSS is able to achieve,

83
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,490
I've built this website for you to be able to do that.

84
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:05,010
If you go over to appbrewery.github.io/just-add-css, you should be able

85
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,540
to see this website.

86
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,020
And when you first go over there, you'll see that it's just a very, very simple website, pretty bland.

87
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,210
All it's got is HTML.

88
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,710
And now if we go ahead and press this button to toggle and turn on CSS, then you'll see the entire

89
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,300
website transform and look way more beautiful.

90
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,840
It's now got different fonts, different colors and different layouts,

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:39,270
but you'll notice that if you go ahead and right-click and view the Page Source, in these two versions,

92
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,580
the HTML does not change at all.

93
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,320
So let's toggle our CSS back and then let's go ahead and View Page Source again.

94
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,710
You'll see that in these two versions,

95
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:56,730
as you see me switch it on screen, nothing changes in our index.html.

96
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,220
The only thing that is different is the CSS that gets added.

97
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,910
Now don't worry too much about the script tags down here or how we've created our buttons,

98
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,870
we're going to learn all of that later on when we learn JavaScript.

99
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,890
But I created this website so that you can play around with toggling the CSS on and off to see how it

100
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:27,000
can transform a simple HTML website without touching any of the code inside the HTML.

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,260
And all that we're doing is adding style to our website in a completely separate language,

102
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,059
the Cascading Style Sheet.

103
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,570
To learn more about how CSS works, head over to the next lesson where we're going to get started styling

104
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,740
up a website.
