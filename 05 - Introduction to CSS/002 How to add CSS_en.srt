1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,310
Now, I hope you had to play around with this example website where you could toggle the CSS on and

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,029
off.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,880
How exactly did I add CSS to this plain HTML website?

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,840
Well, that is what we're going to be learning about in this lesson.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,420
There's three ways of adding CSS into an HTML website.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,670
Inline, Internal, and External.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:34,580
We're going to be exploring all three of these different styles of adding CSS, and I'm going to show

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,380
you why they're important and in which situations you would use which one.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,840
Now, the first one is the "Inline" style of adding CSS.

10
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:51,170
As the name suggests, it goes into the same line as a particular HTML element.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,130
So in this case, you can see we've got an HTML open tag and an HTML closing tag.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,640
Now, we know from learning about HTML boilerplate, this is an element that goes into all of our HTML

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,570
documents.

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,240
There's nothing special about this particular element.

15
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,830
It just tells the browser that this file is made up of HTML.

16
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:21,020
Now, in this case, the inline CSS goes into the opening tag of the HTML.

17
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,110
This is where the CSS exists.

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,830
It's in the same line as the HTML tag.

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,520
What the inline CSS looks like is something like this.

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:44,990
You've got a style attribute, which is an attribute that is globally available to all tags, not just

21
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,390
HTML, but anything else.

22
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:51,440
Image, or Break, or anything you can think of,

23
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,200
you can add the style attribute to it.

24
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,340
As we know, normally attributes look like this.

25
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,530
They have a name of the attribute.

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,440
Then we add the equal sign.

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,180
And then finally we add a value for the attribute.

28
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:14,400
In this value-section is where we add our CSS code.

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,210
Our CSS code is broken down like this.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,610
The first part of it is the property that you want to change.

31
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,650
And the second part is the value of that property that you want to set it to.

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,130
So in this case, what we're trying to do is to set our website's background to blue.

33
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:46,230
And if I go ahead and run this code and load it up in a browser, you would simply see a website that

34
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,700
has a blue background,

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,600
and this is achieved using our inline CSS.

36
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:01,320
Inline elements are really useful for adding CSS style to just a single element on your HTML page.

37
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,720
But normally that's quite cumbersome because as you can imagine, there's tons of different HTML elements.

38
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:13,120
If you have more and more of them and you wanted them to share similar styles, then you would have

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,720
to add these inline styles to each and every single one of them, which is pretty tedious.

40
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,720
It's not normally recommended to use inline styles in your entire document.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:33,100
It's only for specific sections, or when you're testing, or when you only want it in one single element

42
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,860
or one line in your HTML document.

43
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:42,100
Now, the second way you can add CSS is through what's called "Internal CSS."

44
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,400
Now, this is done through a special HTML tag called the "style element."

45
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,550
We've got an open style tag and a closing style tag,

46
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,610
and in between those two lines is where we add all of our CSS.

47
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,060
All of this is our CSS.

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,140
The CSS looks a little bit different from what you saw previously, right?

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,480
Because previously all we had was this line.

50
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,750
Now, in this case, we've got something a little bit extra here,

51
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,100
why is that?

52
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:26,060
Well, this is because last time when we had the CSS rule, we had it inline inside a particular element.

53
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,420
So we said for this HTML element, we want to apply a background color.

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,790
Now, in this case, it's a little bit different because our internal style can apply to anywhere within

55
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,010
the same HTML document.

56
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:49,400
So it could go into any of these elements, the HTML or the head or anything that you've got coming

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,930
up later on as well.

58
00:04:51,110 --> 00:05:00,040
What we have to add in addition often is what we call a "Selector," and this selector comes before a

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:07,300
set of curly braces and then the CSS goes in between these two sets of curly braces.

60
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:15,310
Now, when I say in between a set of curly braces, you have to imagine it a little bit like this.

61
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,450
This is the opening curly brace, and this is the closing curly brace.

62
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:28,090
And if you had it all on one line, then it would look something like this with your CSS going in between

63
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,780
on multiple lines.

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,030
That's why we open and close them on separate lines.

65
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,620
But if you imagine it as one line, then it would look something like this.

66
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:49,660
Our internal styling can apply to anywhere in our HTML document, and inside we can target or select

67
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,730
as many elements as we want.

68
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:59,450
We could say let's apply the background red to the HTML, and when this code is rendered in the browser,

69
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,500
you will see the background of the entire HTML turn red.

70
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:10,700
Internal styles are really useful for applying it only to one HTML document.

71
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:18,200
As you can see, this style and any code that goes in there is limited to the HTML that it sits in.

72
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:25,690
So it means if you have a multi-page website, then you probably shouldn't be using the internal style,

73
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,610
instead, you should be using something called an "External CSS styling".

74
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:39,290
Now the biggest difference between the external, and the internal, and inline styles is that this actually

75
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:47,900
lives in a completely separate file, which you'll normally see as styles.css or main.css or anything

76
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:57,290
that has a .css extension. Inside this CSS file is where we write our CSS rules.

77
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,430
So we've got our selector, we've got our property and we've got values and we can make many, many

78
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,350
of these inside this file.

79
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,950
Now how do we link up the style sheet file with our index.html?

80
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:22,970
Well, inside the head section of our HTML, we would add a link element which you'll notice is a self-closing

81
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,390
tag,

82
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,850
so it doesn't need a closing tag.

83
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,000
And we have two things that we normally write.

84
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:38,510
One which is a relationship (rel) which refers to what is the role of this thing that we're linking to.

85
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,320
And the second thing is the href, which is where is it located?

86
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:51,500
In this case, we're saying it's in the same directory and it's inside a file called styles.css.

87
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,430
CSS, which points to this file right here.

88
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:04,590
And when we go ahead and run this and show it in the browser, you'll see it turns our HTML background

89
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,810
to a green color.

90
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:13,320
And this style of external CSS is what's used most commonly in web development.

91
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,710
And this is what we're going to be focusing on most of the time.

92
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:24,540
But it's important to be aware of the other two styles the inline, the internal, because you'll see

93
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,980
it out there in the wild in other people's CSS code.

94
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:34,169
So remember, inline is really useful when you only want to target a single element,

95
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,590
and internal is really useful when you only want to target a single web page.

96
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:49,290
But for most cases and when you have a multi-page website, then what you're going to need is the external

97
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,950
way of adding CSS through the use of a separate file, which will be called something, something.css

98
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:05,170
and it's inside this file where you're going to be writing the CSS code that can target an entire

99
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,070
website with all of its multiple web pages.

100
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,950
So these are the three ways that you can add CSS to your HTML documents.

101
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,500
And don't worry, we're going to be practicing this and all of its forms many, many times so that you

102
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,660
understand how it works.

103
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:30,340
Let's try an exercise and see how to add CSS in various different ways to our HTML file.

104
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,790
All right.

105
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:38,930
So once you've downloaded and extracted the project file and opened it inside VS Code, you should see

106
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,250
this folder.

107
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,880
And here, notice that our five files that have already been created for you.

108
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,190
And in this exercise, there is a little bit of revision about creating multiple web pages, about file

109
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,820
paths,

110
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:00,800
but more importantly, we want you to practice using the three different ways of adding CSS: inline,

111
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,800
internal and external.

112
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,700
So starting inside index.html, the first thing I want you to do is to create three links to the three

113
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,260
different web pages.

114
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,040
This one, this one, and this one.

115
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,140
And once you've done that, then you can go inside each of those web pages.

116
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,380
So starting with the inline and then internal or external, and you're going to follow the instruction

117
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,040
that the h1 tells you to.

118
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:38,010
So in this case, we want to use inline styling in order to style this h1 in blue. And then you get

119
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:44,130
to go to the internal and do the same thing, but this time using internal styling and styling the h1

120
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:52,800
in red and then finally using external styling using this style.css file and styling the h1 in

121
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,610
green.

122
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,430
If you want to take a look at what the final outcome will look like, you can go into the Solution folder,

123
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:05,670
right-click on the solution.html and show preview. And then make sure that you collapse this solution

124
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,030
folder

125
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,920
because having all of it out, two versions of each file is very confusing.

126
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,290
So I recommend just collapsing that folder so you don't get confused and this is what you're aiming

127
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,380
for on the index.html, which is the home page.

128
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,320
We've got an h1 and then we've got three links.

129
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,260
And if we click on each of these, you can see they've got an h1 that says style me in blue, style

130
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,740
me in red, and green, and we're going to achieve that using the three different ways of adding CSS.

131
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,190
Once you're ready, go ahead and download the starting files and give this challenge a go.

132
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,750
Pause the video now.

133
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,560
All right.

134
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,760
So how did that go?

135
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,620
I'm going to run through the solution code with you to explain some of the things that you would need

136
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,420
to do to complete this challenge.

137
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,770
The first thing we said was to style the home page.

138
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,650
So we added in three anchor tags, which is how we create links,

139
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:11,300
and once we did that, we were able to use the href of each of the anchor tags in order to link to the

140
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,550
relevant web page.

141
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:22,130
The first one links to the inline web page, inline.html, internal external, and we use the ./

142
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,600
notation in order to reach within the current folder.

143
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,630
So solution.html lives inside solution,

144
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:34,910
and in this case, in order to get to inline.html, we use the ./ to get to this folder and

145
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,800
then we forward slash to go to inline.html right here.

146
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,720
Now once you've created your three links, the next stage is to go into the first web page, inline, and

147
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,390
here we want to style the h1 using CSS, but adding it inline.

148
00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:03,840
As I said, it's in the literal line of the h1 element, so it only applies to this h1 element and we've

149
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:12,900
added it in right here saying that the style should be set so that the color of this text is blue.

150
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:23,190
And remember that the inline style goes in the opening tag of the element that you want to target.

151
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:34,470
The next one is I nternal, so we add internal styling, usually by putting it inside the head section.

152
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:41,790
So between the open and closing tags of the head element, and this is a convention that most developers

153
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,770
will stick to, although this will work no matter where you put the style element.

154
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:54,240
So here we've got an open and closing style tag and in between we've added in our CSS.

155
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,590
So we're saying that our selector is going to select all the h1 on this page, of which there is only

156
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,550
one, and we're going to change its text color to red.

157
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,400
And finally, we've got the final version, which is the External HTML.

158
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:19,410
And we do this by creating a link element right again, inside the head section of your website.

159
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,450
We establish the relationship (rel) is we're setting up a style sheet and then we provide a href to the location

160
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,840
where our stylesheet is located, which is in the current directory, and then it's in a file called

161
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,310
style.css.

162
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,310
So we can see that right here.

163
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:46,950
And inside here we've again targeted the h1 and we've set the color to green. And all of that together

164
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:55,470
creates these different web pages in our multi-page website with the code that sets the style in three

165
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,670
different ways.

166
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,270
So did you get that right?

167
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:04,710
If you had any issues at all, be sure to go back into your code and fix anything that was wrong and

168
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:09,030
make sure that you've understood the three different ways of adding CSS.

169
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,910
In the next lesson, we're going to learn more about the different selectors that we can use to select

170
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,220
different parts of our HTML file.

171
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,920
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
