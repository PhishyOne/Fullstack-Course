    <h3>Chapter 17 - Dice Game</h3>
    <p>After a week or two to train up on JavaScript, I'm ready to begin applying it to the web. I made a dice game where two players compete to roll the highest and added a button to run it for extra credit. Just to show I haven't forgotten how to use HTML and CSS, I used things like flexbox and a custom font to make the page a little less boring. Give it a try!</p>

    <h3>Chapter 13 - Capstone - My Own Site</h3>
    <p>This project showcases my knowledge of the combination of HTML and CSS. I redesigned Phishtopia to reflect my progress with a major update of the entire page.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 12 - Web Design</h3>
    <p>I quickly created a hotel home page. I put something together but honestly didn't showcase what I learned. There should be more contrast in the title, serif and sans-serif should be mixed in title and subheading, and additional pages could have been added on. The purpose of my negligence is to show that in 20 minutes, I can make something decent enough to get started with an idea.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 11 - TinDog</h3>
    <p>I created a landing page for a dog dating app using Bootstrap. The page includes several sections which precisely replicates the goal image primarily using bootstrap for modified snippets and examples. Things are starting to come together to look like a real page.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 10 - Mondrian Project</h3>
    <p>My task here was to replicate Mondrian's artwork using grid, almost exclusively and from scratch.</a></p>

    <h3>Chapter 9 - Pricing Table</h3>
    <p>Matching the goal visually and functionally, I made a three-part table using flexbox. This table includes item title, price, description, a button, and background. The table is adaptive to screen size and switches to a single column on mobile.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 8 - Agency Website</h3>
    <p>Given the specs of how the website should be laid out -- using only floats, widths, and block/inline-block displays (no flexbox, grid, or bootstrap) -- I managed to construct their site with a media query to be responsive to display size and stack the content accordingly</p>

    <h3>Chapter 7 - Laos Flag</h3>
    <p>Following strict guidelines, I solved the puzzle of creating the flag of Laos using only CSS to style divs (boxes). Basically, I sized, positioned, shaped, and colored rectangles before sizing and positioning the text to create the flag.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 6 - Motivational Meme</h3>
    <p>Using HTML and CSS, I made a classic-style original meme with a custom font, borders, aligned and transformed text, margins, sizing, and a background.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 5 - Colors in Spanish</h3>
    <p>Created a style.css file where I formatted html text color, font weight, and image height & width using class, tag, and element selectors.</p>
