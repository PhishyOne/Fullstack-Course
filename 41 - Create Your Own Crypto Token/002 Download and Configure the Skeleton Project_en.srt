1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,410
All right, so now let's begin building our custom token.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,820
Now to start, I want you to head over to the current lesson's course resources and download the starting

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,300
project.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,000
So it should be something called token.zip.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:22,380
And once it's downloaded, go ahead and unzip the folder and open up the project inside VSCode.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,680
Now, here, you'll notice that I've already set up the project for React Development, so I've added

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,120
the tsconfig file and I've also modified the Webpack configs.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:40,800
Now in addition, I've added some dependencies into the packaged.json which will get built when we run

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,910
npm install.

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,230
And also I've already created some of the assets such as the favicon and also the React components that

11
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,390
we're going to be working with and building out.

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:01:00,060
So essentially we've got this React frontend with a blank Internet computer Motoko backend and we're

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,490
going to be working on this in the coming lessons.

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,700
But because we've already covered some of the configuration and a lot of the boring stuff, I didn't

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,500
want you to repeat that over and over again.

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,460
So to save time, I've really created some of the barebones sort of HTML and CSS for you so that we can

17
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,160
work on the interesting things, which is working with the blockchain and also writing the JavaScript

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,240
code and Motoko code.

19
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,900
This project was actually inspired by Curve finance.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,930
Curve is what's called an automated market maker.

21
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:41,220
It's really popular and used a lot for people to exchange stable coins and it's used really heavily by

22
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,090
people within the sort of web3 blockchain community.

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:53,190
And the reason why I really like it is because it has this really old school kind of nineties design

24
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,860
feel, like you're working on some sort of old Macintosh.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:04,140
And I basically taken a lot of this design inspiration and built the front-end for our website, which

26
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,410
is going to be called DSurv instead of Curve.

27
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,419
And I want to show you how this looks.

28
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,000
But in order to do that, we have to actually build it and be able to run it locally on localhost.

29
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:25,320
So go ahead and open up a new terminal and use dfx start to start a new local simulated ICP blockchain.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,850
And once that's done, let's go ahead and split out another screen.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,870
And in this one, we're going to run npm install.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,390
And this is going to take everything that's inside our package.json, everything that I've specified

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,210
as a dependency or a dev dependency,

34
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,930
and it's going to fetch that from the Internet and install it for us.

35
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,180
So that's going to take a little while

36
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,300
and it might be worth grabbing a cup of tea, depending on how fast your Internet and your computer

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,660
runs.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,110
Now I fast-forwarded the video there for you, just so that you don't have to sit here and wait for my

39
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,360
packages to install.

40
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:11,620
But at the end of it, you should see that we've added something like 1,447 packages and they will go into

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,760
the node modules.

42
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,340
And these are a lot of the things that are required by the dfinity modules or some of the things

43
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,940
that we're going to be using later on as well

44
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,980
in order to authenticate our users, log in

45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:31,900
users, also a lot of React dependencies and that kind of stuff.

46
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,390
So if you've seen some of these warnings in your installation about deprecation, don't worry about

47
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,260
it too much. Because I've specified the required version numbers,

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,400
you'll probably also see some deprecation here. But just be

49
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,590
rest assured it's all going to work just fine.

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,990
And a lot of this is very minor

51
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:57,280
like the material UI icons might have changed to MUI icons, but it really won't affect our website

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,140
or our security or anything at all.

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,440
Now that we've done that, the next thing we have to do is to go ahead and deploy our website.

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,650
Now you'll notice that in our main.mo I've deleted all the starter code in there, so there's not

55
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,760
much going on there.

56
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,899
But we do need to do a dfx deploy in order to build some of those declarations and other files in order

57
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,120
for the back-end to understand what's going on the front-end and some of that configuration for dfx

58
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,740
to complete.

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:34,720
So splitting out another terminal we're going to do a dfx deploy and this is going to create our wallet

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,230
canister, it's going to build our canister and install it onto this locally running ICP blockchain.

61
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,720
And as it's doing that, you'll see a dist folder being built, declarations folder being built.

62
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,680
And then once that's done and you see deployed canisters, then we can finally go ahead and run npm

63
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:03,350
start. And once we hit enter we'll be able to head over to the localhost, which is localhost 8080.

64
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,530
Or you can actually scroll up a little bit and you'll see localhost 8080 here, which you can simply

65
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,370
copy and paste into the browser here.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,300
You should be able to see the frontend load up.

67
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,430
So we've got our DSurv website instead of curve.

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,640
We've got our faucet, which is where people are going to be able to claim some of our tokens for free.

69
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,660
And then we've got a check balance section where we can check a account's balance.

70
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,390
And finally we have a transfer section where we can transfer to another account some of our custom tokens.

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,200
Make sure that you're following to the step that everything is up and running without any errors in

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,130
the console.

73
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:53,030
And if you have any problems, then be sure to look back at the video and trace the steps one by one

74
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,520
to see if you can get to this step.

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,970
Once everybody is all here, then head over to the next lesson

76
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,600
where we're going to get started building out the check balance functionality on the back-end and tying it

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
up with the frontend.

78
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,980
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
