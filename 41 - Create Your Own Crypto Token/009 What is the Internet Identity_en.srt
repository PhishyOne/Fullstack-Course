1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:09,690
Up to this point, we've been claiming our DANG tokens into the current logged in user of the frontend,

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,070
which happens in my case to have this principal ID.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,750
Now the problem with this is this is actually just an anonymous user. It's actually not a real user at all.

4
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,360
And the reason is because we're not logged in.

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,030
So this user that's operating the website has no principal ID to give our backend to use.

6
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,510
Now you'll notice that when you logged in to, say, the network nervous system or when you initially

7
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:48,930
signed up to get your free cycles from ICP, you had to go through a login process and the login process

8
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,170
asked you to create an Internet identity.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:59,700
And when you create an Internet identity, you able to assign a device to that Internet identity anchor

10
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,410
and it would ask you to verify your identity using either a USB security key or this current laptop

11
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,640
device, which in my case can let me log in using touch ID.

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,790
Now what exactly is this internet identity and how can we implement it in our website to allow authentication

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,640
of our users through the Internet identity?

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,130
That's what we're going to explore in this lesson.

15
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,070
Now, one of the things we were missing is this authentication ability on our website, and we're going

16
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,860
to do it using something that's called the Internet identity.

17
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,180
And the idea with the Internet identity is it's an anonymous blockchain authentication framework that

18
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,130
is supported by the Internet computer.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,590
It's going to fill a similar role to say, log in with Facebook or log in with Google.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,020
And the idea is that authentication and keeping your users' passwords secure is actually quite a difficult

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,670
task technologically.

22
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:05,460
And this is why you've heard of so many security breaches and data leaks, everything from Ashley Madison

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,390
to Equifax.

24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,850
Even big companies aren't very good at keeping login information secure.

25
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,740
A better solution would be to offload this challenging task to a company that's good at technology,

26
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,310
so in this case, Facebook and Google, because they have the infrastructure and they have the investment

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,670
that's already made into authentication and keeping things secure using oath.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,540
But if letting big tech companies know every aspect of your online life

29
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,460
doesn't sound like a good idea to you,

30
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,550
then this is where the internet identity comes in because it allows us to be anonymous. Using the Internet

31
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,080
identity

32
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,570
we can create as many of these anchors as we want.

33
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,360
And these anchors give us a pseudo-identity which we can be used to log in to decentralized apps.

34
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,380
But you can create as many of these anchors as you want or need.

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,410
And the Internet identity at this stage knows absolutely nothing about you.

36
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,460
There's no username, there's no password.

37
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,030
You don't need to provide an email to sign up.

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,770
There's no seed phrases, One-Time passwords, authenticator apps or email confirmations, which means

39
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,240
that companies won't be able to track you across services or even know who you are.

40
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,750
The Internet identity builds on this thing called the Web Authentication API, which is a specification

41
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:32,160
written by W3C and Fido with the participation of big companies like Google, Mozilla, Microsoft and

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,650
others.

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,570
This means that the technology that is behind it will be compatible with all modern browsers and operating

44
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,140
systems.

45
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:46,560
When you create an Internet identity, it's secured using chain key cryptography, the same framework

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,820
that powers the Internet computer. And it uses compatible cryptographically enabled devices such as the

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:04:01,050
fingerprint sensor on a laptop or the face id system on a phone to authenticate you, which from a

48
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,600
user's point of view makes the sign up and login super easy because you don't have to remember any passwords

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,410
or usernames.

50
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,920
All you have to do is just sign in using your biometric data like your face or your fingerprint, which

51
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
makes it super convenient

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,610
and it also eliminates the weakest point of online security, which, to be honest, is you.

53
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,970
It's the ability for you to generate secure enough usernames and passwords and to remember them.

54
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,980
So how does that actually work?

55
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:36,600
Well, when you add a device to an anchor and you generate a new Internet identity, a pair of cryptographic

56
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,530
keys, a private and public key, are generated.

57
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:47,610
The public key is stored on the Internet computer blockchain, while your private key remains locked

58
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,380
inside the authentication device,

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,220
so together with any sort of biometric data that secures the access to it, for example, touch ID. When

60
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,940
you log on to a decentralized app, both keys are

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,320
required to authorize the session and the authorization from the Internet identity then grants you access

62
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,220
as an application specific anonymous identity, which basically allows you to be pseudonymous across

63
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,560
many applications.

64
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,290
And it also lets you create as many of these pseudo identities as you need.

65
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,190
And if you want to learn more, you can take a look at this demo from the Dfinity team, where the founder

66
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,070
of Dfinity talks about how it works in more detail.
