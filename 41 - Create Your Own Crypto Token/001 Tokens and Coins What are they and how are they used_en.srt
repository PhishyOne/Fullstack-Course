1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,160
All right.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,420
So I'm pretty excited about this one.

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,820
We're going to be learning how to create your own tokens on the Internet computer.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,690
And this is really, really cool because you've probably heard a lot about these tokens like Shiba Inu

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,810
or Doge or Bitcoin, Ethereum.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,790
But finally, we're going to be creating our own custom tokens.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,230
So that could be Angela coin, or if you're an Amy, it could be Amy Coin.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,870
And it's really awesome because we're going to get to create these crypto tokens of our own and see

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,680
how the process of building that on the blockchain actually works.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,200
The first question a lot of people ask is What's the difference between a token and a coin?

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,340
Because you hear this a lot.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,520
There's the Shiba Inu token or the Doge coin.

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,050
What's the actual difference?

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,380
Well, the definition is that if you want to have a coin, you actually need your own blockchain.

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,750
So you have to build a blockchain from scratch.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,450
And we'll talk a little bit about the pros and cons of that.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,230
Whereas tokens, you can actually taken advantage of an existing blockchain such as Ethereum or the

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,610
Internet computer blockchain.

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:11,700
Now, what's the difference between these two?

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,950
Well, one common coin that you might have heard off, a meme coin, is Doge.

21
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,120
And there's a meme token which was created supposedly as the Doge killer

22
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,460
is the Shiba token.

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:35,160
Now the dogecoin has its own blockchain and it's basically a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain.

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,690
So somebody created a fork,

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,420
so a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain which was called Lucky Coin, and then the people behind Doge

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,390
as a joke actually created a fork of the lucky coin, which is why we have doge these days.

27
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,090
There's a huge amount of trading in these coins, which is kind of insane, especially given that initially

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,860
they were created sort of as a joke.

29
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,390
The current market cap of circulating dogecoins is something around $17 billion, which is absolutely

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,900
insane.

31
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,720
So then you've got the Shiba coin, which a lot of people refer to as a coin, but actually it's a token.

32
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,850
And the reason why it's a token is because it was built on the Ethereum blockchain.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,250
So the Shiba token doesn't have its own blockchain, and it was much, much easier to create.

34
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,790
And the people who created it were very, very smart at marketing it and leveraged the growing number

35
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,530
of users that use Ethereum.

36
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,950
And as you can see, even though it was created more recently, its market cap is just behind Doge,

37
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,320
something around $14 billion.

38
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,810
And so here are some of the differences between creating a coin versus creating a token. In order to

39
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,830
create a coin,

40
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,920
firstly, you need to create a blockchain, which is not that hard.

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,060
You could just simply make a copy of an existing blockchain.

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,360
But in order for your blockchain to be secure, you'll need to recruit a large number of miners who

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,430
are willing to mine your coin.

44
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:09,840
So in the case of Bitcoin and Doge, that means using up a lot of energy and resources.

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,260
But also you have to find people who think that your coin has a future to be willing to spend those

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,710
energy and that electricity to actually mine your coin.

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,060
Now, on the other hand, with tokens, you don't have to do any of that.

48
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,090
And as we'll see later on, as we create our own token, all we have to do is just to write the code

49
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,870
for the ledger and to specify how our token is going to be transferred and how it's going to be recorded

50
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,980
on our ledger.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,230
And if you're interested in creating a token because you want to reach similar market caps as Doge or

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:53,370
Shiba, then a really interesting story that I came across was how the Shiba token actually rose to

53
00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,470
its current prominence and how it gained a massive amount of following and market cap almost overnight

54
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,160
basically.

55
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,940
So when they first created this coin, they were able to take advantage of the huge number of Ethereum

56
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,080
users because the Shiba token is created on the Ethereum network.

57
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,570
So that means instead of having to create your own decentralized exchange, you could actually just

58
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,839
use existing Ethereum exchanges like Uniswap.

59
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,810
And this meant that there was a massive amount of trading activity from the very beginning, unlike

60
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,740
the case of Doge, where you actually have to build up the following over a long period of time.

61
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,270
And also, you need some sort of exchange so that people can get hold of your coins.

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:43,710
Now, in addition, what the Shiba token creators did is they sent half of the total circulating volume

63
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,410
of Shiba tokens, which was they created a massive amount, something like a quadrillion tokens,

64
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,960
and they sent half of that to Vitalik Buterin, who's the founder of Ethereum.

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,850
Now, because the Shiba token was created on the Ethereum network, then you can

66
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,600
do this as long as you know somebody's public

67
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,680
wallet address.

68
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,120
And they were very clever because they sent it to one of his cold wallets.

69
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,620
So it's a wallet that isn't online, that isn't necessarily what you would use day to day.

70
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:19,250
Instead, it's a wallet which required basically two pieces of paper that he had, one on him and another

71
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,500
all the way in Canada with his family.

72
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,350
And during COVID, it was really difficult to actually get hold of these two pieces of information in

73
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,290
order to actually be able to access these tokens.

74
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,540
Because what he wants to do immediately is to get rid of them, because he doesn't want to be seen as

75
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:42,380
supporting any of these tokens or any of these new meme coins and fluctuate its value and potentially

76
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,530
be involved in shady dealings or be accused of stuff like that.

77
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,420
So it took him a lot of effort to basically burn a lot of these tokens that he got sent.

78
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,310
And burning it just means destroying it or sending it to a wallet that can't be accessed.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,450
And what he had left was something around $1 billion worth of Shiba tokens, which he then donated to

80
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,760
the Indian COVID relief fund.

81
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,840
And he basically said, in the future, please don't send me these coins.

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,100
I really don't want to be involved.

83
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,450
But in this case, it's really interesting just because of the sheer amount of money that he was essentially

84
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,990
given.

85
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:32,270
And this sort of story also legitimized Shiba token in some way because they could say, look, you

86
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,810
know, the founder of Ethereum owns Shiba tokens, so you should, too, and continue their very successful

87
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,010
marketing campaign.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,630
But history aside, what are tokens used for?

89
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,910
We've already seen that they're used for payment,

90
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,360
so you can exchange one token for another token or you can exchange one token for some sort of service

91
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,110
or product.

92
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,310
But you can also use tokens in very novel ways.

93
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,590
You can have them as equity.

94
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:09,080
So you could give people a certain amount of tokens so that they can vote on the future of your decentralized

95
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,830
application.

96
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:18,650
For example, in ICP, you can buy ICP tokens and you can stake them on the Internet computer to vote

97
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,030
for certain agendas.

98
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,430
And in turn you'll be rewarded for doing that

99
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,370
and also your tokens will go up in value.

100
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,400
And it's sort of similar to how you might own shares in a company in a traditional sense.

101
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:38,120
Now I know I just said ICP token instead of ICP coin, even though the internet computer technically

102
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,380
has its own blockchain.

103
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,540
But to be honest, the word token is what you hear being used most often these days, regardless of

104
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,320
the distinction.

105
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,660
And finally, you've got another category of tokens which are sort of for utility purposes.

106
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,320
For example, if we think about the cycles that we got from the faucet when we deployed our decentralized

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,840
application, those cycles are a form of token and they used to be able to interact with a particular

108
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,730
application or for some sort of functionality within the application or blockchain.

109
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,420
So in our case is to be able to pay for computing cycles.

110
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,410
But you've got other tokens as well.

111
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:25,060
For example, the We Power, the WPR token, which is actually something that represents a real-world item.

112
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,480
It represents energy.

113
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:33,740
And this is a blockchain that allows small providers and small companies to directly exchange energy

114
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,380
for these tokens on this blockchain.

115
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:43,340
Or you've got axie infinity where you can earn AXS tokens when you play various games within the

116
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:50,840
Axie Infinity Universe, and you can use those for payment, for staking or for voting and governance

117
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,290
as well.

118
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:00,470
So with all of that said, I hope you are as excited as I am to start creating our very own tokens.

119
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:07,400
And in this tutorial I'm going to be creating my own custom token, which I'm going to call the DAngela

120
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,670
token or DANG for short for our currency.

121
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:17,110
So let's get started creating of very own awesome tokens on the ICP.
