1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,180
The first thing you're going to do is open up your terminal.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,170
So the first thing that you might notice is that my preferences or my display or the skin on my terminal

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,880
might look different from yours.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,220
Now I have it, this green on black

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,980
just because I do a lot of development at night and it helps my eyes and it helps me going to sleep

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,850
afterwards.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,180
And also there's the added benefit of when you're sitting in Starbucks and doing a lot of bash scripting,

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,220
people look at you really funny, like you're going to hack into their phone or something.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,580
And if you really want to take it to the extreme and you've never seen this website called hackertyper.com

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,080
and you can actually pull it up on your browser and you can basically just bash the keys and you look

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,710
like you're writing some insane piece of code.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,460
This is actually part of the Linux kernel in case anybody's interested

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,160
and it's written in the C programming language.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,580
So that also is something that you can impress your friends.

15
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,210
Now, coming back to our actual lesson, let's talk about the first command that we're going to learn

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,810
today, which is "ls", which stands for list.

17
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:15,400
And this lists all the items inside a particular directory.

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,500
So you can see the location of where you are by whatever shows up here.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,940
So at the moment, this tilde shows me that I'm in my user directory, so that in the Finder world is

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,960
basically here.

21
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,290
So the root or the highest level in the hierarchy is your Macintosh hard drive,

22
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,590
and then the next one is your users folder

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,130
and on this computer my username is Angela Yu.

24
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,630
And when you see that tilde sign, you are at this level.

25
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,230
You are inside this folder right now.

26
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:56,770
If I wanted to list all the items that are inside that folder, then I simply write the ls command and

27
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,580
hit enter.

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,880
You can see it prints out all of the folders and files,

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,970
so I've only got folders inside my root directory and you can see that it's exactly the same as what

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,199
you see in Finder.

31
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,960
Now what if you don't want to be inside this folder?

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,370
What if you want to navigate to a different directory, right?

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:22,990
Say, for example, if I wanted to go into My Documents and I want to go into Learn and I've got this

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,840
folder called Languages and right now I'm learning German and the International Phonetic Alphabet in

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,420
case anybody's interested.

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,890
So how do I get myself from here all the way inside here?

37
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,160
Well, this is where the change directory or the "cd" command comes in handy.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,120
We know that we are here right now because of the tilde sign.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,090
Let's navigate one level down.

40
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,120
Let's go into our Documents folder so I can simply write cd Documents.

41
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,700
Now I can type out the entire thing myself,

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,090
but as a developer, we're always looking for lazier ways of doing things and faster ways of doing things.

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:11,440
So if you start typing Doc and you hit tab, you can see that the terminal will auto-fill the remainder

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,940
of your folder name.

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,240
Now you need enough letters for it to know what you're talking about.

46
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,850
So for example, if I just wrote Do then it will tell me that there's Documents and Downloads,

47
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,230
which one do I want?

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,160
So if I add a w and then I hit tab, then it knows that it can only be Downloads, for example.

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,240
Okay, so let's change the directory to Documents and you can see that the location has changed,

50
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,780
this directory name is now saying Documents.

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,270
So that means I am currently inside here I am at this level.

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,360
So if I wanted to go into this level, I would have to navigate into the Learn folder.

53
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,540
So if you're following along, what would you type?

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,500
Give it a go.

55
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,690
Similar as what we did before,

56
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,820
we're simply writing "cd Learn" and hit Enter.

57
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,470
So now we're inside Learn.

58
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,440
Now it's a little bit tedious to navigate through directories one by one by one, right?

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,050
If we already knew that we want to go all the way into here, then we can actually specify the entire

60
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,730
path to get there.

61
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,250
For example, right now I'm inside Learn,

62
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:30,260
let's go back to our route so I can say "cd tilde" and hit Enter.

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,800
And now I'm back at my root directory, which is here.

64
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's map out the path that I need in order to get to here.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:46,340
I need to go into Documents and then Learn and then Languages. So I can simply write "cd Documents/

66
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,880
Learn/Languages".

67
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,100
And now if I hit Enter, I am inside languages, which is over here

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,400
and that's a lot more succinct and a lot quicker than going through the directories one by one.

69
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,700
Another really time-saving feature of the terminal is the upðŸ”¼ and downðŸ”½ buttons,

70
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,680
so if you wanted to use the last command that you typed, all you have to do is just hit the up button

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,310
and you can see that I can use that change directory command again.

72
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,520
But in my case I actually want to use the ls command.

73
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,200
Obviously, it's easier to type out ls, rather than cycling through all those

74
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,450
but I just want to show you that you can actually go through your entire history of previous commands

75
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,810
and you can then hit Enter to execute it. And you can see that inside the Languages folder,

76
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:45,120
I have two other folders called German and IPA, so you can tell that we are at this level in our directory.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,460
Now sometimes typing out an entire path like this might seem like it's a lot of work,

78
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,710
so I want to show you another neat trick that you can use when you have the Finder open and you just

79
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,960
want to navigate to a deep directory without having to type out the entire path.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,820
So let's cd back to here, to our root directory for your user.

81
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,350
Do you remember how to do that?

82
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,330
If you do, go ahead and do it now.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,900
So I'm going to cycle back and I've found it,

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,210
it's the cd ~,

85
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,530
and if I hit Enter, I am now back at my user's root directory.

86
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,320
Now once we're inside this Languages folder, how do we change directory back to the parent folders?

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,350
How do we go backwards in this path?

88
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,330
We're still going to be using the change directory or the cd command, and then after a space, we're

89
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,190
simply going to type two dots (..) and this takes us back one level.

90
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:48,960
So from Languages, I'm now in the Learn folder, so I'm now here and I can keep doing this until I'm

91
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,750
back at my root directory right here.

92
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,910
So it took me three cd ... to get back to my root.

93
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:05,070
And the reason why you might want to do this is because, say, if I was inside the Languages folder,

94
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:13,720
so I'm now at the Languages directory and I wanted to navigate now to my Music directory

95
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:21,760
for example. I can't simply write "cd Music", that's not going to work because it's looking inside this

96
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,810
Languages folder.

97
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,940
It's looking to go forwards.

98
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:32,410
So if I wanted to go backwards in the directory, I would have to specify the entire file path to go

99
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,340
backwards

100
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,420
and I can only specify just the name of the folder if I'm going forwards in terms of this hierarchy.

101
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,990
Now, what if I wanted to edit this at some point in the middle of this entire command?

102
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,590
Because you can see that if I click at any of these places, it doesn't really do what you expect it

103
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,140
to do in a graphical user interface, right?

104
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,290
Namely, allowing you to edit these parts.

105
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,930
Your cursor is here and you can only type where your cursor is.

106
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:10,160
So you can of course use the left arrow â—€ to go all the way back,

107
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,630
but this is obviously very time-consuming, especially if your command is very long.

108
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,630
So a neat trick is holding down the Option or the Alt button and it gives you this little plus sign (+)

109
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:28,070
and now you can click on one point in your command and you can now move the cursor to that position.

110
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,120
So that's quite a neat trick as well.

111
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:35,720
Now for people who have come from a long history of using graphical user interfaces such as, you know,

112
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:44,340
your Mac OS or your Windows having these little tricks, like using the Option Click can be quite neat,

113
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:53,910
but if you are a puritanical command line user, then ideally you're aiming for never having to touch

114
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,090
the mouse. And you can do most things that you would want to do with the mouse very easily and quickly,

115
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,090
just using your keyboard.

116
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,010
For example, if I wanted to go to the beginning of this line, then I can simply hold down Ctrl

117
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:14,970
and press A. So my cursor is now at the beginning and if I hold down Ctrl and press E, then I go

118
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,070
to the end of my command line.

119
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,620
Now you've already seen that I can cycle through my previous commands by using the up and down buttons,

120
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,090
but what if I wanted to clear this current command without executing it?

121
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:34,680
So to do that you can again hold down Ctrl and hit the U button and that clears your entire line

122
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,720
so you can write a new command.

123
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:42,660
So in the next lesson, we're going to cover directories, making directories and secret folders.

124
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,220
So I will see you there.
