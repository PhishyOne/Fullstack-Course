00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,860
All right, guys.

2
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,790
In this lesson, we'll go through the installation steps to install Git Bash and Git on Windows.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,910
Mac already comes with Bash pre-installed, so if you're working on a Mac, you can skip this lesson

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,820
and head over straight to the next lesson.

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,400
Now, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to navigate to Git for Windows (gitforwindows.org) and you're going

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
to download the Git SCM.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,200
Now, once that's downloaded, go ahead and open up the installer and select,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,190
Yes.

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,510
And then you're going to agree to the license by clicking.

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,720
Next, select the location where you're going to install Git. On this next step where it asks you to

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,330
select which components should be installed,

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:51,550
make sure that this checkbox next to Git Bash is selected and is checked as Yes.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:59,290
Now go ahead and leave the defaults for the rest and click Next and then leave the default Git as the

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:07,630
folder and click Next, and then keep clicking Next and going with the default selected options.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,130
Select Next.

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,110
And next.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,120
And Next.

18
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:19,900
And just basically keep selecting Next and keeping the default selections from the installer.

19
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,490
Now, once installation is completed, let's make sure that it works.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,070
So let's open up VS Code and open up a terminal. And you can find that on the top menu.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,590
Click Terminal. New Terminal.

22
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,510
And then in this new Terminal, click on that dropdown button next to the plus sign (+) and select Git Bash.

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,080
Now you should see something similar to this with a dollar sign ($) in the Terminal.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,470
Now, in order to configure VS Code to make Git Bash your default shell, we have to go to the command

25
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,010
palette, and we can find that by going to View, Command Palette.

26
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,380
And then in the Command Palette, we're going to search for "Select Default Profile."

27
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,870
And once that comes up in the dropdown, select it and then select Git Bash.

28
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:16,290
And this is going to set it so that every time you open up a new terminal, we're working with Git Bash

29
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,530
as the selected terminal.

30
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,820
So let's try it out.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's click close down that terminal, select a new one and you can see Bash showing as the profile

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,350
for our terminal.

33
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,180
And there you have it.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,080
That's all you need to do to set up Git Bash on Windows.

35
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,840
And in the next lesson, we're going to learn what the command line is all about, what Bash is all

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,120
about, and why it's useful.

37
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,000
So for all of that and we'll I'll see you there on the next lesson.
