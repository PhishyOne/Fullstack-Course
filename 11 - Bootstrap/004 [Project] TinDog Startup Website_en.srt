1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,560
All right.

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,740
So now that you've learned all about Bootstrap, it's time to apply what we've learned and build a project.

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,620
I want you to imagine that a startup has approached you to build their landing page.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:20,480
So the company is called TinDog, and they make basically tinder for dogs, helping dogs meet new and

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,460
interesting dogs nearby.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,720
Obviously this is a fake startup that I've created.

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,520
Now, if you want to go ahead and steal this idea, then I fully support you.

8
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,770
But essentially the idea is very simple.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,100
You have a dog, you want your dog to have friends, so let's use tin dog.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,770
Now our website is pretty fully fledged and if you want to look at what the finished product looks like,

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,700
head over to appbrewery.github.io/tindog

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,480
And this is what you'll see.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:56,600
It's a really simple startup website with an animated gradient background with buttons to download the

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,230
app, as well as features, testimonials, pricing, and a footer.

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,710
We're going to be creating this beautiful website, and the way we're going to do it is through the

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:17,510
use of the different Snippets that are provided by Bootstrap as well as the different Components and

17
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:25,160
using Bootstrap Layout to get it responsive and looking beautiful on desktop and mobile straight out

18
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,150
of the box.

19
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:34,070
To get started first download the TinDog project, unzip the file and open it inside VS Code.

20
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:43,430
Now here I want you to open up the index.html and you can see I've provided some comments and some Section

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,810
HTML elements.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:53,300
These section elements are mostly used to separate different sections of a website, so it's just a

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,790
group or area of the website.

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,660
And in modern websites you'll see very often these sections.

25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,750
So this one is a section, this is a section, this is a section and it keeps the code nice and organized

26
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,790
and you're going to be writing your code in between these section elements in order to create each of

27
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,000
these areas.

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,150
Now, what are you aiming for?

29
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,530
Well, you can always refer to the live website at appbrewery.github.io/tindog to see what everything

30
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,850
should look like.

31
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:31,170
But I've also provided goal images for each individual section that's marked up to point you to certain

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,030
areas that need more attention.

33
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,900
For example, what's the name of the image that's going to be displayed here?

34
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,200
Well, it's iPhone.png and you can find it inside the images folder, but also things like this

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,900
little Apple icon is actually an SVG and you can find those inside the README.

36
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,890
So I've included all the SVG code in here and I want you to be copy and pasting these svgs because some

37
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,440
of them have different heights, they have different sizes and instead of getting it from the Bootstrap

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,220
website, which this is from, I want you to use this version.

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,070
So just copy and paste it into your code.

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,840
Also, if you scroll down, there's the text copy that you'll need on your website and so you can either

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,680
copy it straight from the final finished website or you can use the text from the README and just copy

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,580
it from here.

43
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,540
If you're working as a web developer, this is a very common workflow.

44
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,120
You'll want your client to create the text copy because they know the most about what they want on their

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,730
website, and all you have to do is just place it and style it in the right ways.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,180
Now, the final thing I want to mention is if you look inside the style.css, this is going to be your

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,820
CSS style sheet for the website.

48
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,770
You can see that already in there.

49
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:57,900
I've got a class called "gradient-background," and this code comes from a codepen by Manuel Pinto where

50
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,550
he created a pure CSS gradient background, and we're simply just using this code but defining some

51
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,530
unique colors of our own.

52
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,730
And you can see in here we are having our animated gradient, hovers between these three colors, a blue,

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,829
a red and a sort of peachy color.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,570
And that's how we're going to get this gradient background. Similar to other things you've been doing

55
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,470
with Bootstrap,

56
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,590
in order to get this gradient to show, all you have to do is to add this class to your HTML element

57
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,300
and then it will automatically animate with this beautiful color scheme.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,140
This project is going to require a little bit of exploration, a little bit of looking around the Bootstrap

59
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:47,760
example, seeing which ones might work and comparing them, for example, which of the Heroes might

60
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,840
be the one that we could use, or which of the features might match the one that we've got here, and

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,270
customizing it and checking its CSS, and

62
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,990
making sure that things look pretty much the same as the final outcome.

63
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,030
Now it's time for you to pause the video and give this challenge a good go.

64
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
You might have to spend half an hour, an hour on it.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,610
Just give yourself lots of time to make mistakes.

66
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,600
Try things out.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,030
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

68
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,830
This is a big project, but I believe in you.

69
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,000
I think you can do it.

70
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,280
Pause the video now and see how you get on.

71
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,130
All right.

72
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:34,880
Hopefully you've completed this challenge and you're just here to see how I'm doing it.

73
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:41,460
If you haven't given this a go, I really recommend you to stop, pause the video and actually try it

74
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,190
first because you can listen to me all day long, but you're not going to learn until you actually take

75
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,560
the first step and write the code yourself.

76
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,020
I know it can be really, really tempting, but I promise you this is the only way you're going to be

77
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,480
able to move on to harder things in the future by struggling through each and every single step.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:06,660
Because once we start moving on, I'm going to assume that all of these things are in your tool belt.

79
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,600
So make sure you practice, practice, practice.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,790
And this is a perfect opportunity.

81
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,420
All right,

82
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,230
pep talk over.

83
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,200
Let's go ahead and build out this website.

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,590
Now, the first thing I'm going to do is build out this Title section.

85
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:25,260
So if we take a look at the title-goal, we can see it's pretty much what we call a Hero section.

86
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:32,500
If we take a look inside the Bootstrap Examples and we look inside the Hero's area, you can see

87
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,200
it looks incredibly similar to the layout here.

88
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,780
It's got some big text, some buttons and an image to the right, which is pretty much what we have.

89
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:48,760
So let's go ahead and right-click, Inspect and scroll up to the top level that contains everything

90
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,320
just after the divider and let's copy the entire element.

91
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm going to paste that element into this section area and let's hit save and see what it looks like.

92
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,350
So I'm going to show preview just to get this URL and I'm going to open it inside Chrome so I can see

93
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,790
it in full screen.

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,030
Now you can see this doesn't look like Bootstrap at all.

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,490
The text is not the right font,

96
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,780
and the buttons are not styled,

97
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,580
this is just pure HTML.

98
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,450
This should give you a big hint as to what is wrong.

99
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,670
And that is because we have not yet added a link to the Bootstrap CSS.

100
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,920
So let's go ahead and do that now.

101
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,750
So if we go back to the main Bootstrap Docs and go to the home page, we should be able to grab hold

102
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,310
of the link and we can paste it into our project.

103
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,090
So now let's hit, save and go back to our TinDog.

104
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:52,630
We should see that we have what is closer to the example that we saw right here.

105
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,720
There's a couple of things that we will need to fix.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,430
First, let's go ahead and get rid of this broken image and put in the image that we want.

107
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,920
Here is the image.

108
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,670
So let's go ahead and change the source to our image, which is inside the images folder.

109
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,530
And it's called iPhone.png.

110
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,430
And let's change the alt to "app demo".

111
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:20,680
Let's hit, save and go back and we can see this is absolutely massive.

112
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,470
So now we're going to have to adjust the size.

113
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,760
So here it's set to width, 700 height, 500.

114
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm going to keep the aspect ratio.

115
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,740
So I'm going to delete just the width and hopefully it will adjust proportionally and I'm going to change

116
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,870
the height to 200px.

117
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,750
And this looks more or less the right size.

118
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,480
Now yours might be a little bit bigger, a little bit smaller.

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,810
It doesn't really matter as long as it looks good to your eye.

120
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,080
Now the next thing we're going to do is let's change all of this text so that it reads the same as the

121
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,220
final copy.

122
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:01,210
And to do that, I'm going to find the text inside my README, go ahead and copy and paste it into

123
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,530
the right areas.

124
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:09,160
So we've got an h1 and that's where we're going to replace with our big heading, "Meet new and interesting

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,360
dogs nearby."

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,510
And then I'm going to delete this paragraph element because we don't actually have it in our final design.

127
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,170
And I'm going to change the two buttons to both say "Download."

128
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,780
In addition to the download, there's obviously two SVGs as well, and these are the icons from Bootstrap,

129
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,840
but remember I mentioned that you can get hold of these SVGs in the README file, so I'm going to wholesale

130
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,880
just copy this Apple SVG and paste it into here.

131
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:48,610
Add a space between the SVG and Download and now hopefully we have a good-looking Apple symbol in the

132
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,650
Download button and I'm going to do the same with the Google Play logo.

133
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,520
Hit save and that's it.

134
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,310
There it is.

135
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,730
We're going to change the color scheme here a little bit.

136
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,550
We've got a btn-light and we've got a btn-outline-light so that it would look the same as the

137
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,760
final design.

138
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:16,060
Now, right now, this button is a btn- primary, so we're going to have to change that to light.

139
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,660
And this one, instead of btn-outline-secondary,

140
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,110
we're going to change that to btn-outline-light.

141
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,260
Let's hit, save and see what we have.

142
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:32,650
Now you'll notice that this button is almost completely disappeared if not for this rollover effect,

143
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,400
and the reason is because it's more or less a white outline.

144
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,400
In order for this to show we need a background.

145
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,380
So let's go ahead and set it up with this CSS gradient background.

146
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:51,040
Remember I mentioned that if you look inside the style.css file, there is already a class called

147
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,540
gradient-background, which we can add into our HTML for it to show up.

148
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,350
Now where do we add it? Before we can add it

149
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,400
we need to import our CSS and as always, we put our custom CSS after the Bootstrap.

150
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,940
So in case there are any collisions in terms of targeting the same selectors, the final one wins out,

151
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,180
which hopefully is our CSS.

152
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,960
So I'm going to link to the style CSS and then I'm going to put that class gradient-background into

153
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,820
my Title section.

154
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,560
So where do I put it?

155
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,350
Now, if I put it inside the container, you'll see that it's only inside the container and the container's

156
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,270
got these big margins on the left and right.

157
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,850
So this is not the look that we want.

158
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,710
Instead, we're going to put this inside the section.

159
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,660
We can't put it into the ID because it's not an ID, it's actually a class.

160
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,980
So make sure you've got it set inside the class property.

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,420
Now let's take a look,

162
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,520
and this looks pretty good.

163
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:01,820
Now, the only difference between what we have and what we're aiming for is a lot of padding.

164
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,600
Now, the reason I can tell this padding and not margin is because padding extends the background.

165
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,560
So if this was an extra margin, then this area would be white,

166
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,570
but instead, it's actually the same as the background color.

167
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,070
So where does this margin come from?

168
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:26,300
Let's go ahead and hit, Inspect and make this just a little bit smaller so we can see this padding.

169
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:33,080
And if we scroll up until we see the padding show up, you can see that orange down there when I hover

170
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,740
over it.

171
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,490
Well, that is what we need to get rid of.

172
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,800
So you can see we've got padding-top and padding-bottom,

173
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,530
and if we get rid of the top and bottom, it will look a little bit too much.

174
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,530
So if we just target the bottom, then we've got more or less the right layout.

175
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,720
So let's go in here and find that py-5 for the container which is right here.

176
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,880
And remember, the P stands for padding, the Y stands for the y-axis.

177
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,210
So it means it's adding padding to the top and the bottom.

178
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:12,770
So if we want to change this to only have it on the top, then we change this to pt, padding-top and then

179
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,760
we've got another div that has the padding on top and bottom as well,

180
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,200
so let's change it there.

181
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,690
And then when we go back we should see that we have pretty much the same layout.

182
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,140
And now if we compare our layout to the final outcome, it looks pretty much exactly the same.

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,120
So we can now move on to our next section, which is the Features section.

184
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:43,580
If we open up our features goal, you can see that we've got three different areas with all of the features

185
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,200
that we want to show off, and we've got this sort of rough layout.

186
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,160
If we go back to the Bootstrap examples and if we look inside the Snippets at the features, you can

187
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,090
see this is pretty much the same layout as what we're aiming for.

188
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:05,710
So let's go ahead and Inspect and find that row that we need to get hold of.

189
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,330
Let's copy the element and put it inside our index.html.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,640
Now once we paste it in, let's hit, save and see it.

191
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,090
You can see this is occupying pretty much the entire full width, which is not quite what we want.

192
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,220
We actually want it all to be roughly along the same vertical line.

193
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,740
So why is this?

194
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,240
Well, it's because the top level here is a Bootstrap row.

195
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,160
If we want it to be contained, then we need to add a container.

196
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,930
So let's add that container class and then let's move this closing tag to wrap it around all of this.

197
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,950
Hit save.

198
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,000
And now you can see we've got that perfect alignment.

199
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,520
The next thing we need to do is.

200
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,820
Is that we need to get rid of all of these buttons and that is pretty easy.

201
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,730
They're just these anchor tags.

202
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,120
So there's one there, there's one here and there's one up here.

203
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,470
So now we're pretty much on the design we're looking for.

204
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,080
All we need to do is replace the text.

205
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,600
This is probably a little bit boring, so I'm going to use video editing to speed things up a bit for

206
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,050
you.

207
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,950
All right.

208
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:28,780
So now that we've got all of our custom copy in, the final thing we need to fix are these SVGs.

209
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:35,350
So let's go ahead and replace the SVGs that are in the example with the ones that we want.

210
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,580
So the first one is going to be the Checkmark SVG. Let's copy and paste it in.

211
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,720
The second one is the Graduation Hat.

212
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,490
And the final one is the Heart with an arrow through it.

213
00:15:52,420 --> 00:16:00,370
So now that we've replaced all of our SVGs, you can see them show up, but the background doesn't look

214
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,270
quite the same.

215
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,020
It should have these rounded corners, it should be a little bit larger,

216
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,980
and when look on the Bootstrap example where we copied our code from,

217
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,570
they look perfect.

218
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,920
But why is it that when it's in our website it doesn't quite look the same?

219
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,470
Now this might be something that you got stuck on, but in order to figure this out, the easiest way

220
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,090
is to Inspect on it

221
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:29,770
in Chrome. You can see right now I'm highlighting the SVG, but if I go one level above and hover on

222
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:34,270
that div, that is the one with all of that fancy styling.

223
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:41,350
And if we look inside the styles, you can see there's actually some custom CSS in here because it's

224
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,190
not in the Utilities which comes from Bootstrap.

225
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,970
This is actually custom CSS just for this feature section.

226
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:57,320
So what we need to do is we need to copy all of the CSS and put it inside our style.css.

227
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:05,720
So now this icon square, which is the class for this div, can be activated

228
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,650
and when we look at it now, you can see that they all have the right styling that we expected.

229
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:19,040
So the final thing we need to sort out is just to add a little bit more margin in this Features section

230
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,710
and then we're pretty much done.

231
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:28,069
So if we look at the features goal, you can see I've given you a hint that it's actually margin-top

232
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,000
5.

233
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:36,200
If we want to add some margin to this entire container, then we can go up to the div class where we

234
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,210
have the container and then we add margin-top 5, mt-5,

235
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:47,180
and now we should have enough space between that top title section and our feature section.

236
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,320
So we're now ready to move on to the Testimonial Section.

237
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,210
Again, let's take a look at the goal that we're looking for.

238
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,800
So the first section is an h2 with an image and some paragraph text.

239
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:09,740
This area comes from this Jumbotron section, and if we scroll down, we can see this full width jumbotron

240
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,790
right here.

241
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:18,950
So let's go ahead and Inspect on it and let's take the entire section just after the divider.

242
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:25,670
So let's copy the element and paste it into our Testimonial section.

243
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,430
Let's take a look at what that looks like.

244
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,900
It looks pretty good, but we need to modify it for our purposes.

245
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,690
So let's change the text inside.

246
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:43,550
If we go over to our README, we should see our quote here from Pebbles and we can replace the text

247
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,050
inside the h1.

248
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,710
Remember from our HTML classes we should only have one h1 per website,

249
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,600
and remember at the beginning in our title section we've already got our big heading.

250
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,170
So here it should really not be an h1.

251
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,060
Let's turn it into a subheading by changing that to an h2.

252
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:14,150
Now this paragraph element, I could delete it, but I'm actually going to keep it and use it for showing

253
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:19,640
the name where the quote comes from, which is Pebbles from New York.

254
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:28,910
And all I have to do now is add an image in between, and the image is going to be our dog image and

255
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,460
I'm going to add the alt text as well.

256
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,790
Let's take a look at what that looks like.

257
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,700
It looks great.

258
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,960
Other than the fact that this should be rounded and it should be a little bit smaller. If we look at

259
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,460
the goal, we can see it should be 100px high and it should be circular.

260
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,730
So how do we make it custom?

261
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,980
Well, we're going to need to create some styling, right?

262
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:03,110
So let's create a class called profile-img and let's set it to have a height of 100px,

263
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,240
and in order to make it circular, remember, we need to set the border radius to 50%.

264
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:19,470
Now, if we apply that class to our image, profile-img and we look at our website and you can

265
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,570
see that looks pretty much perfect and similar to what we've got here.

266
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,800
Now, the only thing we need to add is just a little bit more margin.

267
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:36,120
We should have a margin of 5 between these two sections and a margin of 2 between these two sections.

268
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,540
So I'm just going to add some margin top to the image.

269
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:49,610
So a size 5 margin to the image so I can hit space on the class and then do mt-5,

270
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:56,370
and then for the text, I'm going to do a class of mt-2.

271
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:04,320
And now we should have enough space in between everything and it looks pretty much the same as the example.

272
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:12,480
Now we need to add in all of these outlets that have featured our startup, and you can see from the

273
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:21,510
goal-image here that we've got a 12-column grid here from Bootstrap and they're each occupying a fourth

274
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,710
of the space.

275
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,790
But notice here where I've said it should take up three columns on desktop, but a full width, 12 columns

276
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,630
on mobile.

277
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:36,540
So it should be responsive and we can find all these images in the images folder.

278
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:46,140
Let's go ahead and add that below this container. In order to create the Bootstrap 12-column layout system,

279
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,430
the first thing we always need is a container.

280
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:58,860
So let's create a div of class container and inside here is where we need our div that has a class of

281
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,810
row.

282
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,810
So now we're ready to create our columns.

283
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:13,110
Each of the columns are going to be three columns in the desktop format, so that's  col-large

284
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,360
and it's going to be -3, but on mobile,

285
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,500
so col-sm, small is going to be full width,

286
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:29,730
so 12. And inside here we can place our image which is from the images folder and we're going to start

287
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,860
off with TechCrunch and I'm going to add the alt text as that.

288
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:42,750
Now I'm going to copy this and paste it three times and now I'm just going to replace each of these

289
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,480
images with the ones that we have here.

290
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,140
So Mashable, Business Insider and TMW.

291
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,580
All right.

292
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:56,250
So now we should have all of our images, but they are a little bit large.

293
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,780
One thing we can do is we can limit their height so that they are all equal in height instead of having

294
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,660
this uneven start and end line.

295
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:15,780
So I'm going to set the height to 30 and that should be enough height to be visible, but not so much

296
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,090
height that it takes up too much space and that looks pretty good.

297
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,660
So now we're done with our Testimonial Section and we are on our penultimate section, which is the

298
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,920
Pricing plan.

299
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:35,940
And as you'll remember, Bootstrap has the Pricing Plan section right here.

300
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,560
And these three cards are the ones that we want to get hold of.

301
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:46,970
So let's Inspect on that and find the area that we need, which is probably this div row.

302
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,880
So let's copy it and put it inside the pricing section,

303
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,630
but as you remember, a div row needs to go inside a container.

304
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,740
So let's go ahead and do that.

305
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,050
And if we look at our pricing table then it's already in and looks pretty good.

306
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,820
The other section we need is a title for the pricing table, which is this area right here, and this

307
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,210
is the div that contains all of that content.

308
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:21,960
So let's just copy it and put it at the beginning of our container right here.

309
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,430
So now we've pretty much got the pricing table down.

310
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:33,000
We just need to update all of the text here to the ones that we have in our copy.

311
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,370
So I'm going to do this again quickly.

312
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,890
I'm going to fast forward and replace all the text.

313
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,460
All right, so now all the text has been replaced and you should see all of that text inside the Pricing

314
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,240
Section.

315
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,790
So now we need to update the design a little bit.

316
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:04,620
And the main difference is the color scheme here is all using the Bootstrap primary color, which is

317
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,640
this blue,

318
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,030
but we need to change it all to the dark kind of color, which is this kind of black color.

319
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:18,300
And if you look inside the pricing goal, you can see the parts that we need to change.

320
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,910
This needs to become outline-dark.

321
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,980
this needs to be btn-dark, btn-dark,

322
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,570
and this also needs to be dark.

323
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:32,790
A shortcut here is to simply use the Ctrl + F on Windows or command + F on Mac in order to bring up our

324
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:33,660
search bar.

325
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:41,460
And if we search for the word primary and we replace it with dark, then we can actually go through

326
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,700
each of these examples and see if we want to replace it.

327
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:50,770
What I recommend doing is to actually do this one by one.

328
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:56,230
So instead of doing replace all, because that way you can see which parts you're replacing,

329
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:02,200
and many times I've done replace all only to find out that I've messed up the entire project in some

330
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,860
big way.

331
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,840
So just a word of advice,

332
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,340
go through it one by one,

333
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,150
make sure that it makes sense and it's the right area that you're changing.

334
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,550
But hopefully, when we go back to our website, we can see we've now updated all of the right places

335
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,650
to this dark color scheme.

336
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,740
Coming back to our pricing-goal, we can see that this title needs to be an h2 and this subtitle needs

337
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,120
to be a paragraph element.

338
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:35,470
So let's go into our section and make sure that is the case, because when we copied it over, it actually

339
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,240
gave us an h1.

340
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:42,790
Now the styling is not going to change because it actually comes from the display for class.

341
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,660
So you won't see the size change that much or the color scheme because it is actually not dependent

342
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,760
on the HTML element.

343
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,400
And this happens very frequently with Bootstrap, so we're able to adjust that pretty easily.

344
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,870
And now we're ready for our final section, which is the Footer.

345
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,920
So let's find ourselves the Footer Snippets and let's find the one that looks like one that we want,

346
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,260
or one that is similar to the one in the Example, which is this one right here.

347
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:21,220
And let's find the container that we can copy and put into our footer section.

348
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:29,560
So now straight up we can see our footer section show up and all we need to do is to adapt it to our

349
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,460
design.

350
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,950
Firstly, you'll notice there's this area that you can't really see, but when you hover it, it seems

351
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,120
to be clickable.

352
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,080
And if we refer to our code, you can see this is actually a link that links to the Bootstrap logo.

353
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,810
So let's go ahead and delete that,

354
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:54,880
but let's change this paragraph class to copyright (@) and then the name of our company, TinDog.

355
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:01,030
And I'm going to leave these links alone because I don't know, maybe in the future you'll want to use

356
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,440
this website and put in some different links to different sections.

357
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,230
But for now it just kind of looks more or less the right kind of style that we would want on a startup

358
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:11,950
website.

359
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,240
So let's leave that alone, but let's get rid of this border line here.

360
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,220
And this border came from the footer.

361
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,530
So there should be a hint in here.

362
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,590
If we look at the footer element, you can see there's the border-top class, which again comes from

363
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,750
Bootstrap, but it's a really simple way of adding some borders to the top left or right.

364
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,630
But once we delete it and that's completely gone.

365
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:40,990
So the final thing we need to do is just to add that gradient background to the footer area and then

366
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,430
we are pretty much done.

367
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:51,240
So let's take that section footer and add the class gradient-background, and now hit save,

368
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,260
and we should see that we have almost the same website as the final result.

369
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,840
The only thing that we need to do now is to get rid of this little bit of space at the bottom.

370
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,950
And the fact that it's white should give you a hint as to what it is.

371
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:17,430
If we select our footer section and we go into the section, look inside the container, at some point

372
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,180
our hover is going to show us where that margin comes from.

373
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,220
And right here you can see that orange box showing that margin at the bottom.

374
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,780
So if we select it, we should see there are some margin classes applied.

375
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,600
So there's a margin-top, which I think we should probably keep because it adds a good amount of spacing

376
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,130
between the different sections.

377
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:44,100
But the margin-bottom we could probably get rid of so that we don't have that white space down there.

378
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,570
So let's find this

379
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:55,050
y-5 class in our footer element and it's right here and let's change it instead of y to just having

380
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,340
it on top.

381
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,220
And now let's hit, save and refresh.

382
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,470
And you can see we have now completed our design for our website.

383
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,720
In less than half an hour,

384
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,760
we've managed to build an incredibly complex and beautiful website for our TinDog startup.

385
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:21,090
I hope our clients will be pleased because we've created this amazing, incredibly modern looking website

386
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:28,170
for them and we should be pleased because it only took us so little time to do by leveraging the power

387
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:34,980
of the Bootstrap Components and using the different Helper Classes, Utilities, as well as Snippets

388
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,210
that they provide.

389
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,720
Hopefully, this gives you an insight into how we can use Bootstrap to create beautiful, complex websites

390
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,560
quickly.

391
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:50,830
And also you see the difference between what CSS grid, Flexbox and Bootstrap are all good for.

392
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:58,330
They all have different strengths and weaknesses and I think Bootstrap is really good for throwing some

393
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,220
components down and creating something that looks incredibly modern very, very quickly.

394
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,980
Whereas Flexbox and Grid are great when you want to get into the nitty-gritty of creating a very, very

395
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,370
custom layout for your website.

396
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,130
So well done on completing this section.

397
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:20,110
And in the next section we've got the Capstone project for CSS.

398
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,660
So once you're ready, head over to the next section.
