00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,890
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,230
In this lesson, we're going to be learning about one of the most powerful features of Bootstrap and

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,090
one of the biggest reasons why we would be using Bootstrap in our project in the first place,

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:19,460
and that is the concept of the Bootstrap Components. The pre-built, pre-styled components like buttons,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,030
and cards, and carousels, and a whole load of beautiful things that we get access to simply by adding

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,390
in a Bootstrap class into our HTML.

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,480
Let's start with one of the most commonly used components, which is the Bootstrap button.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,410
And this is a really good place to start because you also see the default Bootstrap styling and the

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:47,920
color scheme. In most of the components that you'll get access to through Bootstrap,

10
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,440
if you want to give it a particular color,

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,360
it's really easy to access all of these default colors by simply using their name. In most cases in a

12
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,690
Bootstrap design website, the primary button, the "Go to", the "Buy", or the "Contact Us", or

13
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:13,470
"Download" whatever will be this blue color and you can access all of the other colors through each of

14
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,930
their Bootstrap names and they give you a little bit of a hint as to what they're used for.

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,560
So success is usually like an okay button. Danger,

16
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,130
maybe if you click this button, something really bad happens,  or Warning, etcetera. And you get access

17
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:37,950
to this button and this button styling, simply by creating a button HTML element, giving it the class

18
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:45,210
"btn" for a Bootstrap button, and then adding the class for the color scheme from this list that you

19
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,200
want to choose.

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,730
Let's try this out.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,990
Go ahead and download the starting files from the 11.2 Bootstrap Components zipped file and once you've

22
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,690
extracted it, and opened it inside VS Code,

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,970
head over to index.html.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,090
Now here you'll notice that I've already added in  the Bootstrap link, we've got a style section which

25
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,780
we can add custom CSS to, and in the body area, I want you to use the Bootstrap documentation.

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,780
So if you go to the Bootstrap main website at getbootstrap.com, go to Docs and then scroll down to

27
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:26,370
the Components find the Buttons, and I want you to put in a green button that says, okay, somewhere

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,630
onto this website.

29
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:34,170
Remember, you can preview it in real time to see if it's working and pause the video now and complete

30
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,100
this challenge.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:36,930
All right.

32
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,760
So this is pretty simple.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,480
We have a button which we said is going to say, "Okay".

34
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,500
And in order to style it using Bootstrap, the first thing we do is add the btn class and you can see

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
automatically the font changes, the background color changes,

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,830
and then we said we wanted to have a green button.

37
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,490
So the green button is "btn-success".

38
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,820
So let's go ahead and add btn-success,

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:09,030
and once we're done, you can see we've got a beautiful green button with a hover animation with nice

40
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,330
styling, a good size, rounded corners, all of that goodness without doing a lot of work at all.

41
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,940
It was super, super simple to create this. And this should give you a taste of what's yet to come.

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,820
The next component I want to talk about is a really useful one, which is the Card which you already

43
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,250
saw in the previous lessons' exercise.

44
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,880
And as always, all we need to do is go to that particular Component's page and then we can simply copy

45
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,490
the code, paste it into our website and replace certain parts of the code, such as the image source (src)

46
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,720
or the alt text.

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,390
Now, one component that you're probably going to be using whenever you're building a website is a

48
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,940
navbar and the Bootstrap navbars are some of the best-designed navbars I've seen,

49
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,500
and it also is super easy to include simply using their example snippet codes.

50
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:09,610
If you head over to the Navbar, you can read on how it works and also what's some of the examples

51
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:17,260
they have, for example, this one with a Search bar with some dropdowns, and this one which describes

52
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,200
how you can have the brand at the top left or if you want an image, image and text brand and you can

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,860
scroll through this to find the kind of navbar you want to create and to use the example code.

54
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,820
Now another area for the navbars is if you head over to Examples and you go to the Headers Section,

55
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:45,040
you can see some even more fancily laid out navbars over here. In order to show you some of the different

56
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,060
types of components and how they can be used in real life.

57
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,920
We are going to be building a Moving startup's website.

58
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:00,700
They're called Move It, which is pretty simple and it's got a one page website with many different

59
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,940
sections and I'm going to show you just how easy it is to build this entire fully fledged website using

60
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,770
just Bootstrap Components.

61
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,280
So the first thing we need is that navbar, and you'll notice that I've taken the navbar that is pretty

62
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,050
much this standard one.

63
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,710
So it's got a field which you can search for, say the postcode,

64
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:27,070
if our company works in your area, it's got some dropdown menus, it's got some other little areas

65
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,570
which you can click on.

66
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:37,540
So let's go ahead and copy the code for the starting point of our navbar and let's paste it into the

67
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,700
body of our code.

68
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,540
So you can see as soon as I've done that, I've got my navbar show up,

69
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,640
but one thing you'll notice as soon as you start playing around with it is when a Bootstrap navbar

70
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:57,370
is in a smaller width, it will automatically show a hamburger menu and that menu should have a dropdown

71
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,010
with all of the buttons from the navigation bar.

72
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,460
Now why is our button not working?

73
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,910
Now remember previously I said when we get started with Bootstrap there's two links to include via CDN.

74
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,410
The first one is the style sheet and that gives us all of the styling,

75
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,950
but the second one is the scripting code that gives us all of the functionality because this gives us

76
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,760
access to the Bootstrap JavaScript code.

77
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,990
Now we don't need to understand anything about JavaScript just yet in order to use it.

78
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:37,030
All we need to do is copy that link and go to, right at the end, just before the closing body tag and

79
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,190
paste that script link in there.

80
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,160
And you can see as soon as I've done that, my buttons now work, my dropdowns work and all of these

81
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,360
clicking functionality bits start working and this again comes straight out of the box from Bootstrap.

82
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,710
Let's take a look at this website in a larger format.

83
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,370
By opening Inside Chrome, you can see that for the most part, these two nav bars look pretty similar.

84
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,630
All I did is got rid of some of the components and changed some of the other things.

85
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:13,000
For example, this button is disabled so that users can't click on it,

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,880
and in our version we actually just got rid of it.

87
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,850
We can do that quite easily by finding that button.

88
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,970
And you can see the reason why it's not enabled is because it has this class of disabled.

89
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,490
So if we get rid of that, then you can see this button is now active once more, but we don't actually

90
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,510
want it at all.

91
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,810
So let's delete that entire list item

92
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,800
and now,

93
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
we only have three links,

94
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,160
Home, Link and Dropdown.

95
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,910
So let's rename those links to About and Services.

96
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,420
And again, because this is just a simple anchor tag, you know exactly how to work with this.

97
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,400
So the first one is Link,

98
00:07:52,400 --> 00:08:01,370
so we'll change this to About, and the Dropdown instead of reading Dropdown will say it's called Services.

99
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:07,310
And you can imagine in the future we would have our different services in the dropdown, like Moving

100
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,440
with a van, Moving by, Hauling everything yourself, or something else.

101
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,130
But this is just an example of how our navbar could look.

102
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,660
Now the first part of the navbar is the "navbar-brand" and we can see that right up here.

103
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,680
We've got an anchor tag which is called the navbar-brand, for example,

104
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,120
if I change it to move it, then that's going to change our brand text.

105
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,059
In addition, we can also have an image in here so you can simply just add an image, give it a source,

106
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,690
maybe let's use one of the images we already have in our folder,

107
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,810
for example, the dog.jpeg.

108
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,600
Now, because this image is super, super large and we haven't really resized it, then it's not really

109
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,230
going to work in the navbar, but you can always change this.

110
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,630
So let's change the height to just 20px.

111
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,140
Then you can see our navbar brand image show up right there.

112
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,960
Now in our case, we're not going to use an image.

113
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,490
Instead, I'm going to delete that tag and I'm going to use an SVG.

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,010
This is a good time to show you the SVGs which are available through Bootstrap.

115
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:20,670
So if you go back to the home page and you click on icons, you can see you got all of these free icons

116
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,950
for you to use in any of your websites, paid, monetized, whatever,

117
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,830
and it's really hard actually, sometimes finding well-designed icons that you can simply add to your

118
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,430
project without having to pay royalties and buy it from a designer.

119
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:43,170
So this is also really, really neat and you can search through the different icons by using the filter.

120
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,650
So the one that I found is actually this box with seams on it, which looks very much like a moving

121
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,150
company box to me.

122
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:57,780
And you can either simply just copy the SVG straight up into your HTML.

123
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,540
So if I paste it in here, you'll see it show up right there.

124
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,890
Alternatively, you can also include it as an image and you set the source to the SVG that you have

125
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,800
saved in your folder, which is right here.

126
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,370
I'm going to use the image in the folder by setting it as a source and I'm going to set the alt text

127
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:25,500
to "moveit brand icon," and then I'm going to change the height to, let's say 30 so that it's a little

128
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,280
bit bigger.

129
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,870
And we now have a navbar that looks the same as the example.

130
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,900
Now on the right hand side, there is a form here and I know we haven't spoken much about forms that's

131
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,620
all yet to come.

132
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,110
When we learn more about how to have the actual form functionality later on, especially in the back-end

133
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,170
section, this is all going to come in really, really handy.

134
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:53,580
But for now, we're just going to change this Search bar from Search to say, Postcode and Check.

135
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,500
So that's pretty easy to find.

136
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,350
You can either use command + F to find those words, or you can scroll through your code to find it as well.

137
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,540
Let's change the button to say, Check and let's change the placeholder for that search bar into, say,

138
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,590
Postcode.

139
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,500
There we go.

140
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,320
And now we've completed our navbar.

141
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,960
And if you had a design, all of that from scratch and all of the CSS that's included and you can see

142
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,990
just how much CSS there is actually, if you click on one of these items, you can see the nav link

143
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:35,220
that I just clicked on has all the padding defined, has all of this defined, has toggle styling,

144
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,980
and that's just one part of this entire navbar.

145
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,340
So you can see just how much time we're saving ourselves and we're able to leverage a professional design

146
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,270
and create something that looks really contemporary and beautiful.

147
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,580
Now let's move on to the next section.

148
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,030
And this entire section is made up of different components.

149
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,160
So maybe an h1 heading, a paragraph, two buttons and an image, 

150
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,710
but if we want to just take this layout, I actually got it from the examples.

151
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,130
The examples area is really, really good for taking bits and bobs of the different code snippets,

152
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:17,400
the different Components that they've already styled and created for you, and simply putting it into

153
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,770
your website where it makes sense.

154
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,780
So this is a Hero,

155
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,240
and as you can see, it's this one.

156
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:31,560
It's pretty much exactly the same title, text, two buttons and an image, and everything is styled beautifully

157
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,810
already for you in order to use it.

158
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,730
All we need to do is right-click

159
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,360
on Inspect,

160
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,560
and now we want to expand our elements area.

161
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:49,660
And what I tend to do is just to go upwards on the hover until the highlight actually highlights the

162
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:52,900
area that I want, which is this div right here.

163
00:12:53,050 --> 00:13:00,010
Let's go ahead and copy this div and put it into our code just below our navbar.

164
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:07,040
Now once I've done that, you can see we've got our centered screenshot, text, button and an image.

165
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,530
Let's first fix that image so we can see what things should look like.

166
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,040
And their source is from the Bootstrap Docs,

167
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:22,900
but instead, we want to use the one of the moving van so that we can show our users what our services

168
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,190
are all about.

169
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,330
And now all we have to do is just to replace the text.

170
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:36,260
If you look inside the starting file folder, there is a file called website-text, and here you can

171
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,180
simply copy all of the website text and replace the relevant parts.

172
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,310
The h1 should say "Move With Joy" and then we've got a long bit of text which we're going to replace with

173
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,660
our paragraph.

174
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,060
So let's just copy everything in that paragraph element and replace it.

175
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,770
And then our buttons should say, "Get a quote" and "Contact Us".

176
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,940
And now we have a Hero Section done in two seconds.

177
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,740
Okay, maybe it was a little bit longer, but you can probably see just how powerful this is.

178
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,450
So now let's keep going.

179
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,880
In the next section of our example website, we've got some features and this is where you would usually

180
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,270
tell people what's so special about your particular startup?

181
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,580
Well, our startup is really professional,

182
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,240
we are available countrywide, and we have a personal touch.

183
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,220
And you might have guessed this comes from the Bootstrap Examples page.

184
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,460
They have a section called Features, and this first feature is perfect for our needs.

185
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:47,070
And I think a lot of Bootstrap design kind of comes from Apple, because when you look at the Apple website,

186
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,450
a lot of the buttons, the shading, the kind of fonts, they all look really, really similar to the

187
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,590
Bootstrap Components.

188
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:02,940
And I think this is probably one of their design inspirations and we can get that simply with some copy

189
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,100
and pasting and a little bit of customization.

190
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:12,940
Again, let's go into the section of the features that we want and then we're going to keep hovering

191
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:20,320
up until we find the div that contains all the things that we want, right-click, copy, copy element,

192
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,220
and we're going to put it below the previous section.

193
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,860
Now let's take a look at our good work.

194
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,580
We have our columns with icons and we've got three features.

195
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Let's change the text of all of this 

196
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,490
first, and I'm going to fast-forward through this section so you don't have to watch me copy-paste.

197
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,240
And there you have it.

198
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:53,500
We've now got all the text replaced and we should have all of our copy, which is the text for your

199
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,190
website inserted into the relevant parts.

200
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:04,000
Now, one thing that you'll notice is very obvious is that this part does not look like this part.

201
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,030
And it also doesn't look like the part that we copied the code from.

202
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,120
So what is going on here?

203
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:15,900
Well, as I mentioned, most of the Bootstrap Styling and Components come from Bootstrap classes.

204
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,780
For example, this one looks like this because it has a class of "icon-link".

205
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,550
But sometimes,  sometimes we might want to customize the styling that we get so that we have some of our

206
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,660
own design features on top of what Bootstrap already addresses.

207
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:40,150
If we right-click on these styled squares from the example website, and if you scroll up to find the

208
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:48,010
div where it highlights the entire square, you can see that this div actually has some custom styling.

209
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,570
Now the reason why we know it's custom is because all of the default Bootstrap classes come from something

210
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:00,560
like utilities.css, for example the background gradient, for example the margins, the align,

211
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,340
etcetera.

212
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:08,420
But the parts that come from custom CSS for this page is going to have a file that looks like this.

213
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:15,859
So for this features page, they've created some custom CSS and in that custom CSS file they've got

214
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:23,270
little bits of CSS just to make things look a little bit more custom rather than coming from Bootstrap.

215
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,850
So the part that we're missing, as you can see, is something called feature-icon.

216
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:37,670
So if we copy all of this CSS and put it into our CSS here between the style tags, then we look at

217
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:43,040
our website, we can see those squares styled the way we want.

218
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:51,530
Now what we're going to have to do is to remove the SVG in the examples and replace it with our own

219
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,680
SVG's that we've downloaded.

220
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:57,560
So let's go ahead and find the first one which is here.

221
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,820
Let's go ahead and delete this and simply add an image with the source set as the first one, which

222
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,850
is the "briefcase," because we're saying how professional we are.

223
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:20,630
So let's change the alt text and the second SVG will replace with the image that is the "bus-front,"

224
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,340
and this is because we're saying that our services are available countrywide.

225
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:33,710
And then for the final feature icon, we're going to change it to the "chat-square-heart,"

226
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:41,840
to say how much of a personal touch our company has, and now we should have all of the icons set 

227
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,840
up, but they're a little bit small.

228
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,950
So in order to get it to the right size, we'll do the same thing that we did with the icon up there.

229
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,230
We'll give it a different height.

230
00:18:54,350 --> 00:19:05,150
So let's go ahead and add a height of 30 to each of these SVGs and now they are all correctly sized.

231
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,400
And while you've been doing the copy and pasting, you might notice there's another SVG here, which

232
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,960
is the chevron-right,

233
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,170
which is this little forward button here.

234
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:21,830
We can also replace that with our images, which is the "chevron-right,"

235
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:29,900
and we'll give it an alt text and copy and paste this to all three places where they exist.

236
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:40,970
Now, the reason why the SVGs that we copied from the features section doesn't work on our website is

237
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,450
because SVGs can be installed in many different ways.

238
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:52,640
We can download it just as I have done and put them into the project folder and you can access it through

239
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,430
the SVG element or through an image element.

240
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,460
Alternatively, you can simply copy the entire HTML code. For a clean look,

241
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,520
I've simply downloaded each of the SVGs into our resources folder and added them as images.

242
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,610
It really is up to you how you want to do it.

243
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,880
Now that you've seen a little bit about how we can use the different code snippets from the Bootstrap

244
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,830
Components or from Bootstrap Examples, I've got an exercise for you.

245
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:29,420
We know that the next section after Features, is our Carousel and it's simply a component that allows

246
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,670
you to scroll through different pages.

247
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,980
Now the one that I've chosen here has an indicator at the bottom, so you can easily switch to whichever

248
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,850
page you want.

249
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,330
It's got the side buttons here so you can go left and right and all it has are just three large images,

250
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,440
but be aware that the images don't go all the way to the edge.

251
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,490
Instead, they are aligned with the rest of the content.

252
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,620
So have a think about what you've learnt before.

253
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,310
Have a read of the Carousel documentation.

254
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:06,560
Find the example that you think looks the most like the outcome and see if you can complete this challenge.

255
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,740
Pause the video now.

256
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,440
All right.

257
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,440
If you completed this challenge successfully, we've now got another section here, which is a Bootstrap

258
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,140
Carousel, which is really neat when you want to display some gallery images or maybe you have some

259
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,060
testimonials you want users to be able to flip through and maybe you want to show all the members of

260
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:26,990
your team.

261
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,530
And if you look inside the carousel example here, you can see there's an example with different text,

262
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,070
but the example that I used is actually even simpler than that.

263
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,770
It's in the Docs inside the Components.

264
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,470
So going back to the Components now, we can take a look at how the carousel works if you want to have

265
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,070
a read,

266
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:53,540
But I've chosen one of the basic examples which has an indicator where you can toggle to different pages

267
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,650
and we simply have a big image covering the entire carousel.

268
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:03,050
Let's copy this code and paste it into our website.

269
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,860
Now when you paste it, you won't see anything happen at all,

270
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,930
and the reason is because there's no images, the images are broken and that's because the images have

271
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,180
no source set by default.

272
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,420
So let's go ahead and set our carousel image source.

273
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:24,030
So the first one we're going to set to the "couple" and,

274
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,630
the second one we're going to set as the "dog".

275
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:39,750
This is almost like an evolution of a family going from a couple to a dog to a family.

276
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:43,920
And finally, we have all of our photos set up.

277
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,760
And now if we take a look, you can see our carousel is showing and it's working, but it's maybe a

278
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,850
little bit too big.

279
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,670
It's kind of taking up more than the height of the website.

280
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,880
And that's because this is set to cover the entire width.

281
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:08,190
If you remember from previous lessons, one of the best components to size everything evenly is from

282
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,210
the Layout Section, and it is our Container.

283
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,460
We know that we're going to get a uniform look if we put things inside a container div.

284
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,590
So that's exactly what we're going to do.

285
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:29,370
I'm going to create a div and I'm going to set it to class of "container" and I'm going to move the final

286
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:33,250
closing div just below the carousel.

287
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,140
And now when we go back you can see our carousel is nicely enclosed inside the container and you can

288
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:49,120
see that no matter which size I change to, we've always got a consistent look with that container responsiveness.

289
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,060
We're now ready for the final section of our website, which is just the footer.

290
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,930
And I haven't done a lot of work on the footer,

291
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:06,370
I've simply gone into the Snippets, found the Footers Section, picked one that I liked and then hit

292
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:14,620
inspect to find the starting point of the footer and pasted that code into the correct position.

293
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,600
I'm not going to modify this too much because you already know how you can do that, but just look at

294
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,580
how easy it was to create this beautiful website in a matter of minutes using Bootstrap Components.

295
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,910
The Components are really, really handy, as are the Snippets and the Example code because they allow

296
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:40,030
you to pick a style out of their palette that you like and simply add it into your website.

297
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:46,570
And this makes it super easy to build well-thought out designs very, very quickly.

298
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:53,110
In addition to the Layout classes that Bootstrap gives you the Component classes, there are also

299
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,970
Utility classes and Helpers.

300
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,470
And one really important aspect of this is Spacing.

301
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,180
Very often when we're designing websites, we want to add margin, we want to add padding.

302
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,220
And this is all spacing, right?

303
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:14,770
As you might remember from previous lessons, padding sets up the part between the item and the containing

304
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,160
div.

305
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:25,660
So this part and the margin sets up the spacing between the outline of your item and any other components.

306
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:30,610
So you can set all of those values using very simple Bootstrap notation.

307
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,590
So let's run through this quickly.

308
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:40,120
It's a format where you have the property, which sides you want, a dash and then the size.

309
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,580
And this is really easy to figure out.

310
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:50,110
So for example, if I wanted to set margin only to the top of my element, then I can say "mt". So

311
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,150
M for classes that set margin.

312
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:59,040
T that sets margin-top or padding-top and then using a dash, I can say how much margin I want.

313
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:05,560
So 0 is eliminating the margin and then we can add a little bit more, a little bit more, a little

314
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,070
bit more.

315
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,080
So if I had mt - 5, that's usually the maximum that you'll need.

316
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,580
And then there's this concept of X and Y.

317
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:22,540
So if you want to set the margin for both the top and the bottom, you'll use the x-axis.

318
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,900
And if you want to set the margin or padding for the left and the right, then you can use that y-axis.

319
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,740
So maybe you'll have my -3.

320
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:40,090
It looks like my three, but it actually says, "Set the margin for the y-axis to a size of 3."

321
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,940
It's relatively easy once you understand it, but when you just see it in the code, it can be really,

322
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,870
really confusing.

323
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:55,600
But now you should be able to see that in our footer we've got mb-2 and that of course stands for adding

324
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,620
margin to the bottom

325
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,790
and it's a size of 2.

326
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,220
That's how we can decode all this.

327
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:14,560
Now, the final neat trick I want to show you in this lesson is how you can add "Dark Mode" to your website,

328
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,970
flipping the colors around by simply adding one property into your HTML tag.

329
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,150
If you go into the Customize Section, go into Color modes, you'll see that Bootstrap now supports

330
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,210
Dark mode and it can flip the entire

331
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:38,610
project's theme to the opposite color, simply by setting the data bootstrap theme to dark (data-bs-theme="dark).

332
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,520
Let's try that out on our website.

333
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,440
Let's go all the way up to our HTML after the language is set.

334
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,880
Let's change the theme to "dark," and you can see our entire website has now been reformatted to a dark

335
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,100
theme, which is super neat

336
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,560
if this is the design that you want, or if later on when we learn about JavaScript and we can put in

337
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:08,670
buttons to change the theme of our website to whichever the user prefers so that the user can change

338
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,190
that theme to whichever they prefer.

339
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:18,660
So now you're starting to see how powerful Bootstrap can be using these Examples, using Snippets,

340
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,730
using the pre-built Components and Styling as well as the Layout System.

341
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:29,280
But if you've tried to build websites before, you've probably come across full page themes completely

342
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,410
built-out for you.

343
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,120
For example, with Squarespace.

344
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:39,000
The catch, though, is you're going to have to pay something like Â£12 a month or $10 a month in order

345
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,390
to just be able to use these templates of theirs and to have your website on the Internet.

346
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:51,390
What I want to show you is that with Bootstrap there are a whole bunch of free themes and paid for themes

347
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,210
that you can use that are one-off costs for you to build beautiful websites and simply customize the

348
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:57,790
themes

349
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:04,860
now that you know all about Bootstrap. One handy template is from W3 schools and they have some of

350
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,890
the most common website layouts like a blog.

351
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,620
You might have a sidebar main, a footer or what a portfolio might look like or what a web page might

352
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,160
look like.

353
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,090
A social website.

354
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,570
Etcetera.

355
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,200
Etcetera.

356
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:23,400
And they've built these simple examples for you to be able to simply take the code and customize. In

357
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,500
order for you to use their examples,

358
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,530
you can simply do, as we have done, find a template that you want to replicate and then customize

359
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,390
it and maybe add some more custom CSS in order to achieve the look that you want.

360
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:43,170
If you think that these are a little bit basic because they are, the idea is they're mostly for layout,

361
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:47,940
getting the big structure done using the Bootstrap Layout System.

362
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:54,330
There are a lot of other beautiful Bootstrap themes that are more complete in a way, starting with

363
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,590
the official Bootstrap themes itself.

364
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,000
If we head back to the main Bootstrap website, click on Themes,

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,360
you can see that they've got these professionally designed websites and many of them look absolutely

366
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,500
incredible.

367
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,890
So depending on what it is that you're trying to build, you could use one of these templates.

368
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:20,400
But the only downside to this is they are in fact all paid for because there's a lot of work that's

369
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,600
gone into it, right?

370
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,760
But these are mostly one-off costs,

371
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,450
and if you don't want to pay to get a theme, you can always search through Google for free Bootstrap

372
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,540
templates and you'll find a whole range of websites that have free and paid-for Bootstrap websites.

373
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,590
And again, you can do the same thing as we've been doing so far in this lesson.

374
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,200
Just getting hold of the components you want, customizing it and getting the design that you're looking

375
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,710
for.

376
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,850
So hopefully in this lesson you've seen that Bootstrap can be incredibly easy to create components and

377
00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:00,210
features in our websites very, very quickly, and it has consistent and beautiful design to boot.

378
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,360
And if you've really taken to Bootstrap and web design, you can even create and sell your own themes.

379
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:12,430
If you really enjoy working with Bootstrap and designing websites and creating websites using the Bootstrap

380
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:19,540
Components, you can create the templates yourself and put them onto marketplaces and sell them as a

381
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,040
potential source of income.

382
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:25,600
So have a play around with the other components, see what Bootstrap themes are out there.

383
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,540
And in the next lesson, we've got the final project for this section where you're going to be building

384
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,520
a fully-fledged startup website or by yourself using your knowledge of Bootstrap.

385
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,100
So for all of that and more, I'll see you there.
